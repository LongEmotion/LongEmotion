Once home, following medical advice, he could not eat meat for three months and had to stick to a light diet. However, he successfully quit his long-standing smoking habit during this time. After nearly a month of recuperation, his physical condition has improved from feeling dizzy even when walking quickly right after discharge to currently having no major issues. By all accounts, everything is developing positively.", "But one day, things suddenly changed. In fact, when I was just discharged from the hospital, I still felt a lot of discomfort. The doctor had warned me in advance, and I could accept it, after all, I was just recovering from a serious illness and needed to take things slowly. Therefore, many minor symptoms might have been overlooked in the face of more significant issues. However, as my body gradually recovered, my strength slowly improved. Some minor symptoms that I hadn’t paid attention to before suddenly started to trouble me a lot.", "At first, I constantly felt discomfort in my nasopharynx, as if there was something foreign, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. The more I thought, the more uncomfortable I felt. I always felt my ears were clogged after swallowing saliva, and there was saliva in my throat that I couldn't swallow completely, which I would cough up, only for it to return shortly after. One day, I accidentally blew out bloody mucus from my nose, and I quickly searched online. Comparing my symptoms, I found that it could possibly be nasopharyngeal cancer, which scared me, so I hurried to the hospital to see a doctor. The doctor used a laryngoscope and found only slight congestion and rhinitis, stating that there was nothing serious, and prescribed some medication for me. However, after using the medication for a while, the symptoms seemed to persist. They only seemed to fade when I was suddenly distracted by other things, but as soon as my attention returned, the symptoms came back. Every day, regularly or upon waking up in the morning, I would try to swallow to see if there was any discomfort in my throat. Even now, as I write about these symptoms, that feeling of phlegm stuck in my throat has returned. So, I am almost certain that this feeling is caused by psychological reasons.", "One morning after having a bowel movement, I felt a bit like I had diarrhea and ended up going again. After that, I felt like I never fully emptied my bowels. From then on, every day after using the toilet, I paid special attention to my feelings, and it felt uncomfortable just like the previous time, always feeling the urge to go but unable to. I usually didn't dare to be far from the bathroom. I started searching on Baidu, trying to self-diagnose and find the cause of my symptoms, and eventually, I went to see a doctor. After the examination, the doctor said it was just a bit of internal hemorrhoids and nothing serious. However, deep down, I seemed to never fully trust the result, always doubting there could be other reasons; otherwise, why would the symptoms persist? There was one time when a colleague suddenly called me to attend a meeting, and during the discussion, that discomfort seemed to suddenly disappear. This made me realize: the symptoms seemed to be influenced by psychological factors, just like before.", "I have identified and summarized a few key issues:", "When the stomach feels uncomfortable, the uncomfortable feeling in the throat seems to disappear, and vice versa!", "When both are fine, one tends to deliberately evoke an uncomfortable memory or create some other symptom.

Seeing my family worry about me makes me even more eager to adjust my mindset to face my current symptoms, but the more anxious I am, the less I know how to make that adjustment.", "7. Currently, I can't seem to take much interest in anything. Once I settle down or feel bored, I deliberately start to think about the symptoms of my body and my negative mindset.", "Case Analysis: Anxiety arises when humans realize they cannot dominate themselves, and their perception and behavior are controlled by irrational forces. Therefore, we created science and religion to explain various phenomena, finding an explanation that allows us to control what we cannot understand. For example, when we find ourselves in an emotional low and cannot escape, we receive a diagnosis from a psychiatrist: you have anxiety disorder or depression. Although this is not happy news, it seems to provide a temporary sense of stability, and this result simultaneously points to a clear treatment direction, allowing one to see a glimmer of hope in the darkness. However, whether it is anxiety disorder, hypochondria, depression, insomnia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are all psychological issues; they are neither physical diseases nor diseases of physiological organs. Their existence is entirely due to problems in your thinking, leading to a temporary imbalance in brain neurotransmitters. They cannot be resolved through simple persuasion from others or self-adjustment and encouragement. Although my clients attempt to change and overcome their issues through medication, exercise, and various methods, they are often not very successful and do not address the fundamental problems. This is because medication can only help effectively alleviate the physical symptoms caused by anxiety; it cannot solve the problems in thinking. So what to do? Ultimately, one must turn to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy can help clients explore the deeper root causes behind these anxieties. Additionally, the presence of another person in psychotherapy helps to heal the effects of past traumatic experiences, addressing negative relational patterns underlying the symptoms, such as interpersonal loneliness, feelings of alienation, lack of support, and inner strength, with effects that other forms of help do not possess.", "Consultation Effect: After the consultation began, he continuously talked about his physical ailments, and later mentioned \"hypochondria,\" saying that he felt he had a mental illness. I asked him how this psychological problem came about. He then revealed that he found out after getting married that he was not born to his biological parents but was adopted by his adoptive father, who had brought him from a ravine while working in a coal mine in Shanxi. As a child, he often felt a vague sense of unease and would cry endlessly. He frequently dreamed of being lost in a big mountain and unable to find his parents, crying desperately. In these dreams, there seemed to be a man in a tattered green military coat holding him and a woman in ragged clothes calling out to him, but he could never see their faces. After getting married, his wife informed him about his origins, which was later confirmed by his adoptive parents. He always wanted to go back to Shanxi to search for his birthplace and biological parents, but both his adoptive parents and wife were unwilling, leading him to feel inexplicably irritated and angry, almost causing his wife to consider divorce. To help him reconnect with his biological parents, I conducted a guided imagery dialogue, allowing him to return to that mountain while under hypnosis, where he could vent the anger and resentment he had buried for years towards his biological parents. When the visitor opened his eyes after the session, he seemed like a different person; his wife said she hadn't seen him smile so happily in a long time. The visitor expressed that the heavy burden that had been hanging over his heart had finally been lifted!"], "experience_and_reflection": "From the visitor's narrative, this case represents a vivid example of \"hypochondria,\" a condition that, while often misunderstood, offers profound insights into the intricate interplay between mind and body. Hypochondria is characterized by persistent, intrusive thoughts regarding one's health, often accompanied by compulsive checking behaviors. These characteristics align it closely with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Through my work with this visitor, I've come to realize that addressing hypochondria requires a nuanced approach that transcends merely engaging with the surface-level symptoms. This reflection will explore the depth of insights gleaned from the case, underscoring the importance of exploring relational dynamics and the underlying emotional landscape.\n\nInitially, the visitor's narrative was dominated by an array of physical symptoms, ranging from nasopharyngeal discomfort to bowel irregularities. Each symptom was meticulously scrutinized, often leading to anxiety-driven online searches and frequent medical consultations. This pattern of behavior is indicative of a deeper psychological struggle where the individual seeks to assert control over an unpredictable and often overwhelming internal world. In hypochondria, the symptoms are not merely manifestations of anxiety; they are deeply symbolic, representing unresolved emotional conflicts and unmet psychological needs.\n\nReflecting on the therapeutic process, I recognized the necessity of shifting the focus from symptom management to exploring the visitor's relational world. This pivot was crucial in broadening the counseling perspective, ultimately allowing the visitor to uncover the connections between his hypochondria and his personal history. The realization that his persistent health concerns were less about actual physical ailments and more about unmet emotional needs was a pivotal moment in therapy.\n\nA significant turning point came when the visitor disclosed his adoption story—a narrative laden with feelings of abandonment, identity confusion, and a longing for connection. This revelation provided a critical insight into the roots of his hypochondria. The persistent health anxieties and compulsive behaviors can be seen as a symbolic representation of his unresolved search for identity and belonging. The visitor's discovery of his adoption after marriage, coupled with the resistance from his adoptive family to explore his origins, seemed to exacerbate these feelings, manifesting as health-related anxieties.\n\nThe therapeutic intervention that proved most transformative was the guided imagery dialogue, which facilitated an emotional reconciliation with his past. This technique allowed the visitor to engage with his subconscious mind, where many of these deep-seated fears and unresolved emotions resided. By symbolically returning to the place of his origins and expressing the suppressed anger and resentment towards his biological parents, the visitor was able to release the emotional burden he had carried for so long. The resultant emotional release was profound, as evidenced by the visitor's newfound sense of relief and the noticeable improvement in his demeanor post-session.\n\nMoreover, the visitor's hypochondria served as a defense mechanism, a way to divert attention from the painful reality of his identity struggles and relational disconnects. By focusing on his health, he could temporarily escape the emotional turmoil stemming from his adoption story and the relational tensions it created. However, this escape was only temporary, as evidenced by the cyclical nature of his symptoms. This insight underscores the importance of understanding hypochondria not as a mere set of irrational fears but as a complex psychological condition rooted in relational and emotional dynamics.\n\nAs the therapy progressed, it became increasingly evident that the visitor's hypochondria was intertwined with his interpersonal relationships, particularly with his wife and adoptive parents. His wife's disclosure of his adoption and the subsequent familial resistance to exploring his origins highlighted the relational strains that contributed to his anxiety. The visitor's sense of being trapped between his adoptive family's expectations and his own desire for self-discovery created a fertile ground for hypochondria to thrive. The therapy sessions focused on helping the visitor articulate these relational conflicts and explore potential pathways for resolution.\n\nThrough these explorations, the visitor gained a deeper understanding of how his health anxieties were closely linked to feelings of powerlessness in his relationships. The persistent checking behaviors and obsessive health concerns were, in essence, an attempt to regain a sense of control and agency in a relational context where he felt powerless. By helping the visitor establish healthier communication patterns and assert his needs within his relationships, the therapy aimed to reduce the emotional reliance on hypochondria as a coping mechanism.\n\nAdditionally, the visitor's journey highlighted the critical role of self-awareness in overcoming hypochondria. His acknowledgment of the psychological origins of his symptoms was a testament to the power of insight in facilitating change. While the visitor initially struggled with counter-suggestions and hypnosis, the therapeutic process gradually enabled him to develop a more compassionate and accepting relationship with himself. This shift in self-perception was crucial in reducing the intensity of his health anxieties and fostering a sense of inner peace.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the importance of adopting a holistic approach to psychotherapy. Hypochondria, like many psychological conditions, cannot be fully understood or resolved through a narrow focus on symptoms alone. It requires an exploration of the individual's relational history, emotional landscape, and the symbolic meanings embedded in their anxieties. By embracing this broader perspective, therapists can facilitate deeper healing and empower individuals to reclaim their sense of agency and identity.\n\nIn conclusion, this case of hypochondria offered profound insights into the complexities of the human psyche. It underscored the importance of looking beyond symptoms to uncover the relational and emotional roots of psychological distress. Through therapeutic interventions that prioritize emotional exploration and relational healing, individuals can move towards a more integrated and fulfilling existence, free from the constraints of hypochondria. This journey of self-discovery and healing is a testament to the transformative power of psychotherapy and its capacity to illuminate the path towards wholeness and well-being.", "causes": "Traumatic experiences in personal growth (adoption) lead\nto emotional depression and unmet psychological needs", "symptoms": "Hypochondriasis, anxiety disorders", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nIntentional Orientation and Hypnosis: Venting Emotions", "characteristics_of_illness": "Psychological hypochondriasis and anxiety symptoms\ntriggered by physical illness", "treatment_effect": "Through the exploration of the past, the deep-seated\nreasons behind hypochondriasis are discovered, that is, the\npursuit of self-identity and a sense of belonging, which\nalleviates the anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity caused by\nusing hypochondriasis as a defense mechanism, and the long- suppressed emotions are vented and relieved, and the client\ncan face the problems and difficulties that he may encounter in life with a more peaceful, calm and objective attitude."}
{"id": 2, "case_description": ["One afternoon in the golden autumn, I received a call at the clinic regarding a case from Jiangsu, inquiring about hypnotherapy for insomnia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder. The caller reported that in the past 1-2 months, they had developed severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, including both compulsive behaviors and compulsive thoughts. The compulsive behaviors involved secretly focusing on the genital areas of people around them, as well as the jewelry carried by girls. However, they were very afraid of being noticed, which caused embarrassment, leading to compulsive thoughts. They desperately tried to rid themselves of this obsessive focus and thinking, but the more they tried to escape it, the worse the obsession became, to the point that it caused fear in social interactions and resulted in insomnia. They even took sleep medication but continued to experience insomnia, needing to drink strong alcohol to numb their thoughts enough to fall asleep. This situation severely affected their normal work and life, and they believed it was triggered by focusing on their boyfriend's watch, making immediate treatment necessary. They had also attended a couple of psychological consultations, but found them ineffective.", "Due to the fact that the individual had read some books about psychological suggestion, she understood that only hypnotherapy could quickly and effectively resolve her psychological issues. She searched for hypnotherapy on Baidu and found our Dr. Cao's Hypnosis Center. The individual is a single woman in her 30s, a college graduate, who has had two short-lived failed relationships and works at a foreign company."], "consultation_process": ["After a simple phone consultation, I initially judged that the mental disorder might be caused by past physical and psychological issues. I informed them about the duration of hypnotherapy, the costs, and how to make an appointment. The client eagerly booked a session for the next day with Dr. Cao Zice, who would personally conduct the systematic hypnotherapy.", "At nine o'clock the next morning, the client arrived on time at Dr. Cao's Hypnosis Center in Yangpu District, Shanghai, for a systematic hypnotherapy session. When she arrived, she was wearing a large mask that covered her face, seemingly unwilling to draw attention from others. It appeared that she had reached an excessive level of concern for her personal privacy, which led me to believe that she might be hiding corresponding issues in her psyche, potentially offering a breakthrough point for the problem.", "Due to the fact that the individual had previously undergone psychological counseling without any effect, she initially remained skeptical about hypnosis therapy, believing that her sensitivity to hypnosis might not be strong enough and unsure if she could be hypnotized effectively. Given this concern, I first guided her through a full-body relaxation hypnosis experience and had her listen to the hypnosis of the \"Hypnosis Garden.\" When the individual woke up, she felt fully aware throughout the process. When I asked her about the content she had just listened to, she was unable to accurately and sequentially respond, which led her to surprisingly admit that she had indeed been well hypnotized. This was because, like many others, she mistakenly believed that once hypnotized, one would lose awareness and be controlled by the hypnotist! Through the relaxation experience of the Hypnosis Garden, I corrected her understanding of hypnosis: the hypnotic state is a state of awareness that is even clearer than the so-called waking state with eyes open, and the individual can completely be aware of and control her actions; all she needed to do was to subjectively cooperate with the hypnotist's suggestions.", "With this solid foundation, the subsequent hypnosis became easier and more profound. Sensitivity tests revealed that the individual's hypnosis sensitivity could reach level four on a six-level scale, indicating her sensitivity is above average. At this moment, I am about 80 to 90 percent confident in exploring hypnosis to treat her physical and mental issues.", "Considering her strong obsessive-compulsive tendencies, I decided to break from convention and use Dr. Cao's system of spiritual practice to conduct high-intensity treatment on her nervous system (brain, including psychological aspects). After perfectly coordinating the case and diligently completing this phase, she reported feeling very relaxed and calm inside, no longer experiencing obsession and fixation.", "A series of explorations and healing of the mind, body, and spirit through hypnosis was immediately conducted.", "The specific details are complicated and will not be elaborated on here; let’s highlight a few key points:", "The happiest memory is when she came home for the New Year after being admitted to university, spending joyful moments with many relatives and her parents while playing cards. Remembering the warm and harmonious scenes of the whole family together is the happiest moment in her heart. Therefore, she also wants to start a family and have her own happiness, but her relationships have always been unsuccessful. What is the reason?!", "The person she loves most in her heart is her father, but she didn't realize it during her childhood because her father worked away from home for many years for the family and came back often drinking, which led to conflicts and her dislike for him. However, her father passed away five years ago! Now looking back, she realizes that only her father truly cared for her and understood her the most.", "The person who suffered the most from the incident was her father. After returning home from work one day after the New Year, she found her father drunk. They had a dispute, and during their shoving, she hit her father's face. After the incident, her father couldn't let it go and got drunk for several days, feeling that a daughter hitting her father was unacceptable! A few days later, the case left home to go back to work. Her mother had suggested that she apologize to her father, but she still left. After a few more days, she was still unable to sort out her emotions and even called her mother, asking her to divorce her father. She suggested that after the divorce, they could leave everything behind and rent a place to live. Listening to her daughter's words, her mother temporarily went to stay at her uncle's house and no longer returned home. A few days later, her uncle called her father, saying that her mother wouldn't be coming back and that they had to get a divorce. Her father, surprisingly, couldn't come to terms with it and went to the third floor of their old house to hang himself! During hypnosis therapy, the case sobbed and pleaded repeatedly for her father in heaven to forgive her.", "In hypnotherapy, some answers have emerged: the case is burdened by the guilt of the original family, and her subconscious conscience cannot forgive herself. This is the reason for her insomnia and the ineffectiveness of medication, as well as the reason for her failed relationships. Under the influence of the original family, she must first accept the archetype of her father in order to accept her future boyfriend (husband). Similarly, the behavioral patterns of the original family will also be copied into the child's behavior. The father's incompetence in dealing with issues and alcoholism may be resented by the child, but when the child encounters insurmountable difficulties, they will adopt their parents' ways, which in this case means drinking to fall asleep. (This is true education, rather than merely learning culture and skills.)", "So how did her issue with compulsive gazes form? And what are the causes of social anxiety disorder?", "So continue to hypnotize and delve into the life experiences of the case.", "4. The first onset of obsessive scrutiny began after a recent breakup. In that relationship, the boyfriend was introduced by a relative, very wealthy. During one meeting, she suddenly noticed her boyfriend's beautiful watch but felt embarrassed to ask him about the brand, fearing he would look down on her for being materialistic. So, she secretly took a picture of his watch with her phone. Although she didn't understand watches and never figured out what brand it was later, her worry about her boyfriend discovering this incident grew stronger by the day. As a result, even when she saw her boyfriend or others normally, she became anxious about being suspected of having moral issues. From that point on, it spiraled out of control; the obsessive scrutiny, along with compulsive thoughts resisting this matter, emerged, leading her to fear normal social interactions and ultimately developing into social anxiety disorder!", "This part is addressed in hypnotherapy, but it still seems unable to explain why the case is so severe. It appears that this matter is a trigger, and the psychological issues of the case must be hidden even deeper.

The experience of love after graduating from university for the first time repeated and reinforced these symptoms: She went on a business trip to Japan with a male colleague from the same company. During the trip, he showed her a lot of care, often bringing her flowers, chocolates, and romantic invitations. She also started to develop feelings and longed for a happy love and future family life, so she embraced him and they ended up in bed together, ultimately falling in love! However, she later discovered that he was equally affectionate and flirty with other girls and recently had a wife, making her the other woman! Although she regretted it, she was still unable to extricate herself and continued the secret relationship. Eventually, due to his own reasons, he left the company and publicly revealed their secret affair to everyone when he left... It was a super forced and coercive situation!! Privacy!! Dignity!! Secrets!! Keeping secrets and leaking secrets!!... After breaking up with him, she developed a huge psychological shadow and obstacle regarding her later relationships with other men!", "Since then, it has returned to the recent situation where I wanted to pay attention to my current boyfriend's branded watch, but was worried about being despised and looked down upon by him, which ultimately erupted into today's condition: obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder."], "experience_and_reflection": "Since then, the exploration of hypnosis has found the ins and outs of the cause, and the treatment has come to a perfect conclusion. Reflecting on this case, I am struck by the profound interplay of past experiences, subconscious guilt, and present psychological manifestations. This case exemplifies the intricate layers of human psychology, where early life experiences, familial dynamics, and personal choices converge to create complex psychological patterns.\n\nThe initial challenge was to understand the depth of the client's insomnia and its underlying causes. Through the hypnotherapy sessions, it became evident that her sleeplessness was not merely a surface-level issue but a symptom of deeper emotional unrest. Her inability to find solace in sleep was closely tied to unresolved guilt and self-recrimination stemming from her relationship with her father. This insight highlights the critical role that familial relationships play in shaping our psychological well-being. The client's subconscious mind had internalized the guilt from her father's tragic death, and this unresolved emotional turmoil was manifesting as insomnia.\n\nIn hypnosis, I allowed her to fully express her emotions for every experience she had, facilitating new cognitive coverage and enhancement, inspiring positive insights and meanings. The process of verbalizing her feelings in a safe and guided environment allowed her to confront the guilt she harbored towards her father. This was a pivotal moment in the therapeutic process, as it provided her with the opportunity to forgive herself and seek forgiveness from her father in her mind. The act of forgiveness, both giving and receiving, is a powerful therapeutic tool that can lead to profound emotional healing.\n\nMoreover, the exploration of her past relationships shed light on her patterns of attachment and self-worth. Her failed relationships, marked by secrecy and betrayal, had reinforced her feelings of inadequacy and fear of judgment. The memory of her first love affair, where she found herself entangled in a web of deceit, had left a lasting scar on her psyche. This experience not only affected her subsequent relationships but also contributed to her social anxiety disorder. Her fear of being judged and her tendency to keep secrets were deeply rooted in this formative experience.\n\nThe hypnotherapy session was completed, and the client let out a deep sigh, releasing all grievances and disputes. No longer feeling forced, confused, or afraid, they walked out of my hypnotherapy clinic with a bright heart and full confidence, heading towards a better life tomorrow. This transformation was not just about alleviating symptoms but about facilitating a fundamental shift in her self-perception and worldview. The power of hypnosis lies in its ability to access the subconscious mind, where these deep-seated beliefs and emotions reside, and to reframe them in a way that promotes healing and growth.\n\nThe client's journey also underscores the importance of addressing subconscious influences and the narratives we carry from our past. Her compulsive behaviors, such as the obsessive focus on jewelry and watches, were symptomatic of a deeper psychological conflict. These behaviors were her mind's way of coping with feelings of inadequacy and fear of judgment. By delving into her subconscious mind, we were able to uncover the origins of these behaviors and reframe them in a more constructive and empowering context.\n\nFurthermore, the case highlights the interconnectedness of psychological and physiological symptoms. Her insomnia, compulsive behaviors, and social anxiety were not isolated issues but rather interconnected manifestations of her underlying emotional distress. This holistic understanding is crucial in psychotherapy, as it allows for a more comprehensive and effective treatment approach. By addressing the root causes of her distress, we were able to bring about a more lasting and meaningful change.\n\nReflecting on the therapeutic process, I am reminded of the importance of empathy and understanding in psychotherapy. The client's journey was fraught with emotional pain and self-doubt, and it was essential to create a therapeutic space where she felt safe and supported. The trust and rapport we built were instrumental in facilitating her healing process. As clinicians, we must approach each case with compassion and an open mind, recognizing that each individual's experiences and emotions are unique and deserving of validation.\n\nIn conclusion, this case serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of hypnotherapy. By accessing the subconscious mind and facilitating a deeper understanding of the self, we can help clients uncover the root causes of their distress and pave the way for healing and personal growth. The client's journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for change, even in the face of profound emotional challenges.

{"id": 3, "case_description": ["Visitor, female, 27 years old, undergraduate, employee, home is in Wuqing District, Tianjin. Married for three years. Over the past three years, due to intermittent medication, she has not had children. The visitor self-reports symptoms: has anxiety, which has recently relapsed and feels quite severe, inexplicably irritable every day, sometimes experiences chest tightness and a burning sensation in the back, has been on medication for control but has not fully recovered. A long time ago, she visited a private counseling clinic for a psychological consultation but felt the effect was not good and did not continue."], "consultation_process": ["3. Consultation Objective: How to address the visitor's anxiety issues?", "IV. Consultation Process: It has been 11 days since the last consultation. This is the fourth consultation! During today's session, after half an hour, the client expressed feelings of disappointment regarding the consultation. The client said that apart from the first session, she felt that the second and third sessions were discussing matters unrelated to her, which made her very disappointed and led her to consider changing therapists! I then transparently shared my thoughts and feelings: I mentioned that I also felt our consultations were not normal; typically, the first session may not yield significant results, but as the consultations progress, the effects of the second and third sessions become increasingly evident. However, in our case, it seemed reversed: the first session felt particularly effective, while the second and third sessions seemed to yield diminishing returns. Why was that? At that moment, I suddenly realized that I indeed had a fixation (preconception): I believed that postmodern psychological counseling should de-pathologize; excessive discussion of the client's symptoms might suggest to the client and exacerbate their anxiety. Therefore, in the second and third sessions, I had been trying to avoid discussing the client's symptoms, focusing instead on analyzing the underlying causes of the client's issues and exploring their relationships with others, hoping to find resources in the client's interpersonal relationships to help them enhance their coping abilities. Additionally, in this case's consultation, I was influenced by another similar case: another anxious client was already on their ninth session, and they consistently struggled to confront their own anxiety. In the last consultation, I attempted to encourage that client to face their anxiety and externalize those feelings, but they immediately requested to talk about happier topics. By discussing joyful matters and continually recognizing the relational resources around the client, it reduced their feelings of loneliness and helplessness and provided new insights into their character trait of \"lacking inner security but feeling hesitant to trouble others\" (this is a typical anxious attachment client). However, the current client’s personality was clearly different from that anxious attachment client; they wanted to discuss anxiety issues in every session, while I felt that we had already addressed the anxiety issue in the first session, and it was time to delve into deeper levels of counseling. Yet, it seemed that this deeper consultation could not find an entry point, as the client explicitly told me, \"I just want to discuss how I should cope with anxiety; my problems are not related to my family, so there’s no need to discuss my growth experiences or the impact of my marital relationship on me; all my relationships are pretty good!\" Previously, I would have thought this was the client's resistance, but after studying Chapter 9 of \"Reflective Teams in Action\" and yesterday’s supervision in a personal growth group, I immediately became aware of this realization about myself: I was being hijacked by my own preconceptions and counseling experience, and I was avoiding the client's counseling needs! After this realization, I promptly adjusted the direction of the consultation, focusing on the client and the issues they cared about. The client said, \"This is her own war with herself!\" So, I then focused the goal of the consultation on \"how the client is waging war with herself.\"", "Here are a series of questions I pose to clients during consultations: What is the relationship between the client and her anxiety? What are the patterns of interaction? What does the client envision her life to be like after recovery? The client mentions that she is actually \"the one making herself anxious,\" so how does she perceive this thought pattern? How does she make herself anxious? The client explicitly requests that the counselor \"not ask for reasons, only focus on the present, and concentrate on the outcomes of the counseling\"! This may be disallowed for classical psychoanalysts, but for postmodern counselors, \"there are no fixed rules.\" We will explore the infinite possibilities of the counseling process with the client, with an attitude of equality, respect, and humility!", "Through exploration, the visitor focused on their personality traits: \"I always feel nervous and afraid when facing issues, and I tend to overthink.\" How did this thought pattern develop? What is the difference between \"overthinking and daydreaming\"? Previously, we discussed situations after they occurred and our coping methods. Now let's explore how we perceive these situations and discuss our attitudes towards them. How does the \"anxiety disorder label\" affect you? The effect of a label comes from how you view it; what impact does it bring? The visitor gained new insight about themselves: they are someone who overthinks and tends to nitpick! I asked if this personality trait affects areas other than their insomnia and anxiety. The visitor said they used to be someone who overthought and nitpicked even before their anxiety, which is a characteristic of their personality! (Regarding their new discovery). (I) So what does this personality bring you? (Visitor) Overthinking—tiring—annoying—anxiety! (I) What are the benefits of overthinking for you? (Visitor) A meticulous thought process when doing things, avoiding unexpected occurrences. (I) How do you view \"overthinking\"? Or what is your attitude towards it? The visitor said there is no good or bad in overthinking! When our thought pattern of overthinking is adjusted, could it help with your nervousness and anxiety? The visitor said, \"I overthink and do less!\" They mentioned that their \"overthinking\" often refers to \"daydreaming,\" which is definitely not a good thing. I asked them to describe specifically: why is daydreaming not good, and how does it affect your actions? (Specificity technique). The visitor said that \"overthinking\" might have a positive meaning. However, they said that \"daydreaming\" involves thinking about negative things, which makes them feel exhausted and makes it very difficult to act, leading to a lack of hope. Therefore, they often feel overwhelmed when doing tasks, resulting in \"overthinking and doing less\"! Next, the visitor asked how they could face daydreaming calmly. (Then I used the hypothetical technique from solution-focused therapy) If we are no longer intimidated by the difficulties of daydreaming and just grit our teeth to do it and succeed, how would you feel at that moment? The visitor said: If I succeed, I would feel happy and fulfilled. How would you feel if you approached past daydreaming with this mindset? If you had this successful experience once, twice, three times... or even countless times, what impact would these successful experiences have on your overthinking when faced with situations? You said your irritability comes from overthinking, but if you approach things without being intimidated by daydreaming and adopt a natural and carefree attitude to act, and you succeed, would your feelings about your irritability change? Did you have any successful experiences in the past, even with small things? The visitor couldn't recall anything at the moment, but that's okay. Even without success, would you be willing to try experiencing it with the teacher? I used the metaphor of \"fleas in a glass jar\" to illustrate the negative impact of failure experiences on individuals. At the end, I employed an individual reflection team technique to reflect on the entire counseling process, transparently sharing some of my thoughts and feelings, and acknowledging that I led the counseling down a wrong path due to assumptions and not paying attention to the visitor's expectations. I affirmed the visitor's courage to express their thoughts and feelings and their genuine needs for the interview, which plays a crucial role in advancing our psychological counseling! I sincerely thanked the visitor!", "V. Case Analysis: During these 11 days, I scheduled appointments with the client several times before finally settling on a time. The client mentioned that \"he tends to overthink and has a tendency to grumble.\" This reflects the client's personality traits. Dealing with such a client introduces more uncertainty into our counseling and presents greater challenges for the counselor. In fact, a case can have many different entry points during the counseling process. The true test of a counselor's ability lies in recognizing these entry points and seizing the opportunity to open up our dialogue space and enter the client's inner world. Our counseling has now entered a deeper phase, with the client beginning to turn his attention inward and start reflecting on himself!", "6. Reflection on the success or failure of consultation goals: Why do clients want to change their counselor? It is because our consultation goals have not focused on the clients themselves. So what are consultation goals? I believe it is whether our consultation addresses the current psychological needs of the clients! How can we address the psychological needs of the clients? It depends on whether the counselor can let go of their own preconceptions and consultation routines, and take on the role of a learner and listener, to truly hear the clients' inner feelings and needs. When the clients' feelings and needs are genuinely heard, I believe the direction of our consultation will adjust. Moreover, when clients express the desire to change counselors, if the counselor still cannot see the direction of the consultation, it indicates that we need to seek supervision!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflection on the Consultation Process:\n\nReflecting on my journey with this client, I am struck by the complexities and nuances inherent in psychotherapy. The process of therapy is not a linear path; it ebbs and flows, often requiring us to revisit our assumptions and methodologies. Throughout this case, I have encountered several pivotal moments that prompted me to critically evaluate my approach, leading to a deeper understanding of both the client's needs and my role as a facilitator of their journey.\n\n1. Navigating the Terrain of Client Expectations:\n\nIn the early sessions, I grappled with the challenge of aligning my therapeutic approach with the client's expectations. The client expressed dissatisfaction with our progress, considering changing counselors. This moment was a wake-up call, urging me to critically reflect on my strategies. My inclination to avoid symptom-focused discussions, driven by a postmodern belief in de-pathologizing, inadvertently overlooked the client's explicit desire to address her anxiety head-on. This realization underscored the importance of flexibility in therapy, reminding me that the client's voice must guide the therapeutic journey.\n\n2. The Art of Balancing Theory and Client-Centered Practice:\n\nThe suggestion to explore \"Morita Therapy\" with the client, though well-intentioned, highlighted a critical lesson in the application of theoretical frameworks. While therapeutic literature can provide valuable insights, it cannot replace the tailored, client-specific interventions essential in psychotherapy. The client's dismissive response to book recommendations reminded me that therapy transcends mere theoretical application; it demands an attuned, creative approach that acknowledges the client's unique context and needs. This experience reinforced the notion that therapy is an art—dynamic, personalized, and deeply human.\n\n3. Re-evaluating Homework Assignments:\n\nThe client's reluctance to engage in homework assignments led me to reconsider the role of such tasks in therapy. Initially, I perceived structured activities as valuable tools for fostering self-awareness and coping strategies. However, the client's feedback revealed the potential for such tasks to exacerbate distress. This insight prompted me to embrace a collaborative approach in designing therapeutic activities, ensuring that they resonate with the client's preferences and existing coping mechanisms. Encouraging the client to share their methods, such as daily planning and summarizing, opened new avenues for therapeutic exploration, fostering a sense of agency and ownership in the process.\n\n4. Deconstructing Labels and Exploring Attitudes:\n\nDespite our efforts to deconstruct the \"anxiety disorder\" label, the client continued to wrestle with its implications. This struggle illuminated the intricate relationship between self-perception and mental health. Our exploration of the client's subjective awareness and interpretations of discomfort marked a turning point, shifting the focus from symptom management to an examination of underlying attitudes. This shift encouraged the client to reconsider their relationship with anxiety, emphasizing self-reflection and self-acceptance as pivotal components of the therapeutic journey.\n\n5. Recognizing the Interplay of Personality and Upbringing:\n\nThe client's acknowledgment of the connection between their personality and upbringing marked a significant breakthrough. This realization, once vehemently resisted, emerged through our collaborative exploration of personality traits such as \"overthinking and small grievances.\" By framing this inquiry as a subjective interpretation rather than a definitive truth, I facilitated a space for the client to consider the impact of early life experiences on their current self-concept. This approach underscored the value of gentle, non-imposing inquiry in fostering client insight and growth.\n\n6. Understanding Temporal Patterns of Anxiety:\n\nThe client's reflection on the temporal patterns of their anxiety—experiencing symptoms intermittently rather than continuously—offered valuable insights into the nature of their distress. This pattern, characterized by episodic rather than chronic anxiety, prompted us to delve deeper into the factors influencing these fluctuations. By recognizing the cyclical nature of anxiety, we could focus on identifying specific triggers and developing targeted coping strategies, thereby enhancing the client's sense of control and agency in managing their condition.\n\n7. Building a Therapeutic Alliance Through Dialogue:\n\nThe timely adjustment of our consultation direction facilitated the establishment of a strong therapeutic alliance. By ceasing discussions on coping methods and shifting our focus to exploring attitudes towards anxiety, we opened a dialogue space that encouraged the client to introspectively examine their personality traits. This introspection allowed the client to shift their attention from external problems to internal processes, fostering self-awareness and promoting therapeutic depth.\n\n8. The Role of Supervision in Professional Growth:\n\nThroughout this case, I have come to appreciate the indispensable role of supervision in refining my therapeutic skills. Encountering challenges and uncertainties highlighted the areas where I needed to grow, prompting me to seek guidance and feedback from experienced colleagues. Supervision provided a reflective space to explore my assumptions, biases, and blind spots, ultimately enhancing my ability to attune to the client's needs and adjust my approach accordingly. This commitment to ongoing learning and self-reflection is essential in maintaining the integrity and efficacy of the therapeutic process.\n\n9. Encouraging Client Agency and Resilience:\n\nIn recognizing the client's resilience and resourcefulness, I encouraged them to experiment with new approaches to managing anxiety, emphasizing the importance of self-compassion and self-reward. This empowerment-focused strategy aimed to foster a sense of autonomy and confidence, reinforcing the client's capacity to navigate challenges and embrace personal growth. By celebrating small successes and reframing setbacks as opportunities for learning, we cultivated a therapeutic environment that nurtured resilience and encouraged proactive engagement with life's uncertainties.\n\n10. Addressing Feelings of Failure and Powerlessness:\n\nA significant aspect of this case was the client's pervasive sense of failure and powerlessness in combating anxiety. This emotional undercurrent, initially overlooked, became a focal point for exploration. By acknowledging and validating these feelings, we created a space for the client to express vulnerability and reflect on the origins of their distress. Understanding the roots of these emotions allowed us to collaboratively develop strategies for reclaiming agency and fostering a sense of empowerment, ultimately transforming feelings of defeat into opportunities for growth and resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has been a profound learning experience, underscoring the importance of attuning to the client's voice, embracing flexibility, and fostering a collaborative therapeutic alliance. By continually reflecting on my practice and seeking supervision, I aim to enhance my ability to navigate the complexities of psychotherapy, ultimately supporting clients in their journey towards healing and self-discovery.", "causes": "Emotional repression (guilt) and psychological needs\n(deprivation, low self-worth) caused by personality traits\n(sensitivity, pursuit of perfection) and current life events are not met, resulting in anxiety and physical discomfort", "symptoms": "Anxiety, insomnia, and physiological reactions (chest tightness and back burning)", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nShort-term focused solving: finding resources through interpersonal and early experiences;\nNarrative Therapy: Promotes self-awareness", "characteristics_of_illness": "Intermittent anxiety, the client's desire to focus on the\nproblem and approach rather than seeking resources", "treatment_effect": "Due to the timely feedback from the client, the counseling strategy was adjusted, and the focus shifted from focusing on resources to self-exploration, which more accurately and\neffectively met the needs of the client, promoted the\nreconstruction of the counseling relationship, and provided a new direction for the consultation."}
