{"id": 0, "context": "i had thought tarvik would come to the courtyard as he often did , but i guessed wrong .\ninstead he sent lor back to us with instructions for lor to bring me alone to the castle after dark , and in secret .\ni do n't care much for that idea , i told nance .\nare you afraid to meet alone with tarvik ?\nshe teased .\nno .\nthats not what im afraid of .\nif tarvik tells me to come to the castle in secret , then he must suspect we have a private way to leave the temple .\nwhat ?\nno !\nno one knows of the doorway to the stable but you and me and lor !\nthen why would he ask me to do that ?\nperhaps he suspects , she said slowly , her expression begging me to agree .\nbut he can not know .\nhe will , if i follow his instructions .\ni wanted to believe she was right , that he had nothing more than a suspicion .\ntarvik 's knowledge of the sliding stone to the stable could foul up future escape plans .\nand so to avoid exposing that secret , i told our guards i was to be escorted to the castle , accompanied by old lor .\nthey nodded and smiled , relaxed again now that kovat had left the city .\nit was as though everyone once again felt free to breathe .\nthe only castle resident who never changed was kovat 's large patchy dog .\nit gave me the briefest of glances from where it lay against a closed door , then settled back to sleep .\nwhen we entered the castle , tarvik opened his chamber door , saw the temple guards , and looked surprised .\nyou will leave and return to your posts , he told the guards .\nlor will wait outside my door to return the templekeeper when i command it .\ni stepped into his room and saw artur , the guard with the streaked hair , standing against the far wall .\nhe was slightly taller than tarvik , and , i guessed , several years older .\nhis eyes were a grayer blue , his skin a shade darker , his cheekbones and arched nose sharper .\nnance was right .\nhe was a looker .\ntarvik turned , following where i looked .\nyou , too , artur .\nwait outside for me .\nartur nodded and followed the other guards from the room .\nafter closing the door behind them , tarvik said , i thought you wanted to see me privately , stargazer .\nwhy did you bring guards ?\npushing the hood of my cloak back from my face so i could see him better , i said , i ca n't leave the temple gates without the guards .\nwhy did you leave by the gates ?\nis there some other way ?\nhe frowned , drawing his eyebrows together , and bounced lightly on the balls of his feet , such a fidgety guy , always moving .\nhad kovat once looked like that , young , unscarred and handsome ?\ni glanced around his room .\nrugs woven in bright patterns covered the walls .\ni could n't see any openings in the walls , but i thought there might be some because one of the hanging cloths moved slightly , as though stirred by an air current .\nthe floor was piled deeply with sheepskins and more of the bright wool rugs .\non the side wall several of the stones had been painted blue and against that background there were small drawings of a deer , a bear , a rabbit , a squirrel .\na larger stone contained a picture of a white horse .\nis that banner ?\ni asked , walking over to the wall .\nhe nodded .\nthat 's very pretty .\ni ran my finger lightly over it and could feel the roughness of the stone under the paint .\nhe reached toward me , unfastened my cloak and slid it from my shoulders so quickly , i had no time to protest .\ni am not planning to stay .\nthen why are you here ?\nat your father 's request .\nhe looked startled at my mention of kovat .\nhe spoke with you privately ?\nhe came to see me at the temple this morning before he left .\nwhy should he seek you out alone at the temple ?\nbecause he is free to move about his city and i am not , i said , a bit too carefully , as though talking to a child .\nmight as well get this straightened out right now , wipe out any notion he had about secret doors in the temple .\nwhile my trip to the castle surrounded by guards draws considerable attention , his brief visit alone to the temple did not .\nthe same holds true for you , my lad .\nyou could have come to me when i asked to see you .\nhis lower lip jutted out in that childlike way that made me want to smile .\ni rule the city in his absence .\nit is proper for me to send for you and not the other way .\nnot proper to come to visit me ?\nhmm , then what were all those evening appearances when he banged on the gate .\ni almost asked him if i should turn him away the next time he came to share a story or a dance , but decided not .\nhis rapid changes of moods were puzzling and worth avoiding .\nno surprise that kovat feared for the safety of his only son .\nthe difference between the two of them was this .\nwhile both were brave and arrogant , kovat did not allow his emotions to blind his reason .\nwhat was it that kovat the slayer wanted of a templekeeper ?\ntarvik demanded .\nhe wants me to chart the stars and to warn you if i find anything wrong , uh , dangerous , evil , like that .\nthat caught his attention .\nhe leaned close to me , his face almost touching mine .\nwhat did you find ?\nsomething warned me , maybe some odd sound or maybe that sixth sense thing , but i reached out and pressed my fingertips against tarvik 's mouth to silence him and nodded toward the door .\nfor all the door 's thickness , its rough grain was no barrier to sound .\nfrom the corridor we heard a woman ask , is the templekeeper still in my lord tarvik 's chamber ?\nwe heard lor 's mumbled admission .\nis it his cousin or the other one ?\nthe other .\nyou will return to your stable .\nmy guards will escort her back to the temple .\nin the silence i could imagine lor 's strong , wrinkled hands clenching .\nhe would not want to leave me .\nbut he could not argue .\nthen i heard his slow shuffle down the corridor , his sandals slapping loudly on the hard floor , and i knew he meant for me to hear him and figure out what to do .\nwhich voice is that ?\ni whispered .\nober .\nshe can send lor away , but artur will remain at my door .\ni beckoned him to the far corner away from the door .\nthat 's what i need to warn you about .\nshe plots against you .\nhow can ober be of danger to me ?\nand why should she ?\ni have no answer to that , tarvik , but your father asked me to warn you and now i have .\nwhy should i believe you ?\nno reason at all .\nif you think ober is dangerous , you have put yourself in danger by coming here to warn me .\na thought wrinkled his forehead and deepened his scowl because his thoughts always showed all over him .\ni did n't bother to look to see if his fists were clenched .\ni kept my mouth shut and waited for him to make his own decision .\nfinally he said , stargazer , do you warn me out of loyalty to kovat ?\nno .\ni owe him nothing .\nthen you came because you fear for me .\nfair 's fair .\nyou 've tried to help me .\nand i think if you want me to stay alive , you better send your own guards to escort me back to the temple .\ni do n't trust ober 's guards .\nhe hesitated , glanced at the door , then caught my hand and led me behind one of the heavy wall rugs .\nmusty darkness made me sneeze , probably the musty more than the dark .\ntarvik 's grip tightened .\ni bumped against the wall , then moved through an archway concealed by the rug .\nsecret passages ?\nwow .\nbetween the walls , he whispered .\nhere , this place is always cold .\nin the darkness he reached around my shoulders to wrap me in my cloak that he still held .\nhis fingers touched my throat and his hands fumbled with the clasp .\ni could n't see a thing in the dark but i could feel his touch , hear his breathing .\nand it was back to hand-holding , sword-carrying barbarian time .\nwas he carrying a sword ?\ni had n't noticed and i did n't suppose it was a normal piece of indoor apparel .\nbut the hand-holding thing continued , his warm strong fingers wrapped around mine .\nin a strange , cold , dark , spooky secret passage , it was kind of nice to be able to feel his body heat and hear his footsteps and hang on to his hand .\nalthough i had no reason to memorize the path , i did , trying to place the directions firmly in my mind .\nwe turned corners and stumbled up and down occasional steps .\nat one turning i heard a woman 's voice , her tone too low for me to understand her words .\nthe passage had no lights , no windows , and i could n't see a thing .\ni held my breath and reached out my free hand hoping tarvik , who stalked rapidly in front of me dragging me by my other hand , would not feel my body turn .\nmy fingers brushed the backing of a rug .\nso the passage opened to other rooms .\nwe ended at a blank wall that appeared to be a single stone set firmly in place .\ni could see tarvik now , a shadow shape in the darkness .\neither my eyes were adjusting to the darkness or light entered this inner passage at this point .\ni could n't locate the source .\ntarvik reached up and touched a spot on the wall just above his head height .\na stone door opened into the night air .\nhe pulled me outside and turned me so that i saw the outline of the hill and the distant temple in the starlight .\ni will take you back myself , he said .\nthere was a reason why i did n't want him to do that .\ntarvik , i think you should return to your chamber and perhaps move around and talk loudly so ober hears you .\ni can not let you wander the hill alone .\nlor is waiting nearby .\nwhy not let me walk with you ?\ni think he did not completely believe he was in danger .\nif ober guesses we are gone , she will search your room until she finds the passage .\nshe would not dare enter my room !\ncan you be certain of that ?\nshe came to the temple today to ask me why your father stopped to speak with me this morning .\nhow did she know about that when i did not ?\nexactly .\nbe careful , tarvik .\nwait .\nthere , i see lor in the shadow of those trees .\ngo back .\nit will be safer for us both .\nis he there ?\nyes .\nthen i suppose - stargazer , if you seek me again , come this way .\nhere , let me show you .\npress upon the outer wall to open the door .\ndo you feel it ?\nhe caught my hand and guided it up the wall , then spread my fingers against the latch stone .\nyes .\nstargazer ?\nwhat ?\nto my surprise , or perhaps not , he tightened his hand around mine , circled me with his other arm , pressed his face against my ear and whispered , i have trusted you .\ni have shown you the secret entrance to the castle , known to none but me .\nmy father knows nothing of this passageway and i have never shown it to artur .\nif i trust you , will you trust me ?\nfor a moment i could barely breathe , unsure what he would do if i pushed him away .\nstanding very still , held captive , feeling the heat of his cheek against mine , i tried not to panic .\ni constantly trust you with my life .\nnow hurry , before ober sends out a search party for you .\nhe hesitated , his hand still clinging to mine , then let go , stepped away from me and went back inside the passage .\nthe door closed behind him .\nit perfectly matched the wall .\ni knew lor could hear us enough to know we were near , but could n't see me in the shadow of the wall .\ni did n't need to explain to him what i planned to do .\nhe would wait all night for me .\nhe 'd suspect , as i did , that ober 's guards had instructions to do something other than return me to the temple .\nto wait in darkness with lor nearby did n't take courage .\nthe old man would protect me with his life for nance 's sake .\nto turn and touch the latch stone was another matter .\ni do not like dark , narrow , enclosed places .\nbut i did it , turned , ran my fingers lightly across the outer wall until i found that small chipped spot on the stones .\ni knew i had to return to where i 'd heard the woman speaking .\nonce inside i closed the door , entombing myself .\ni thought i knew where the inner release must be , but i was n't sure .\nif i searched for it now and did not find it , i was going to give in to noisy hysterics .\ni could see almost nothing , a few gray shadows in the black .\nfeeling my way along the wall and counting turns , my shaking fingertips scraped stone until i touched rug backing .\nno sound .\ntracing the wall opening with my hands , i found it to be barely large enough to squeeze a person through , a large stone missing , nothing more .\ni felt my way along the passage until i found the square piece of stone , bumped my toes on it , bent down in the dark and measured its size with my hands .\nwho had removed it and left it here against the wall ?\nober ?\nno .\nif she knew about the passageway she would n't bother to wait outside tarvik 's door .\nshe would have stood behind tarvik 's room and eavesdropped .\ntarvik ?\nif so , then he must already suspect whoever occupied this room and that did n't seem likely .\nperhaps the stone had been removed long ago by someone else .\nif so , the answer lay with tarvik .\nwho had first told him about the passage ?\ni could imagine he had accidentally found the doorway to his own room , but had he also discovered the latch stones at the end of the corridor ?\nthat was harder to believe .\nover the years he had spent a lot of alone time in the castle .\nbut not really alone , not without a guard .\nand he said artur did n't know about the passage .\nis she still in his chamber ?\nthe voice startled me out of my thoughts .\nwe will be told when she leaves .\nthat was obers voice so the first voice had to be alakar .\nwhat did i hope to gain by standing in the space between the walls ?\nwith so many missing planets in their horoscopes , i hoped i could fill in information from elsewhere .\nif ever a place was elsewhere , this was it , a dark passageway with a concealed opening into their room .\nwhy did he send for her ?\nalakar asked .\ni will learn that when i have her in my power , ober said .\ndoes she matter to us ?\nshe is nothing , merely a templekeeper , and so dark and tall and her bones stick out .\ncan we not have her killed now ?\nchapter 11 i bit my tongue and continued to listen .\nnever had liked the looks of that girl , way too smarmy .\nshe may seem nothing to you , but i have watched your tarvik .\nhe looks at her with great longing which is more than he has ever done with you .\nyou 're mad !\nwant her when he is promised to me ?\nwhy should he ?\nwhy indeed ?\nshe requested this audience with him .\nhe did not send for her .\nwhat does she plot ?\nober sounded more as though she was thinking aloud than talking to her daughter .\ndoes kovat long for her , too ?\nober 's low laugh was not pleasant .\nnot that way , you stupid girl .\nsomething else .\ni remember his obsession with the daughter because of her magic .\ni wonder .\ncould this one also possess magic ?\nshe can not be powerful or kovat would have taken her with him to defeat the warlords of thunder .\nto hear their words was scary enough , but it was nothing compared to waiting in the dark passage after their voices died away .\nwhat were they doing ?\nhad they turned to stare at the hanging rug that separated us ?\ndid some movement of the air in the cold passageway stir the hanging ?\nor had they gone to their warm beds while i was freezing ?\nor was ober quietly opening the door to her room and instructing her guards to go outside the castle to grab me when i stepped out of the secret door ?\ni waited for what seemed to me half the night , shivering in the folds of my cloak .\nwhen my patience ran out , i touched the backing of the rug .\nas it moved slightly , a dim edge of light framed it .\nan oil lamp burned in their room .\nleaning my head through the wall opening so my ear pressed against the rug , i listened .\nsomebody was moving around .\nthere .\na footstep .\na scrape .\nwas that a bowl or mug scraping on a tabletop ?\nhow bright was the room ?\nshould i push the rug aside or would they see it move ?\nif i had n't been so positive the lives of tarvik , myself , and maybe nance , too , depended on my knowledge of ober 's plans , i would have felt my way out of the passage and run back to the temple .\ninstead , i moved the carpet aside the width of a pinch at a time , the wool backing catching on my fingers , pausing after each move to listen for the sound of an indrawn breath .\nwhile i waited , i almost wished someone would scream .\nthen i could let go and take off out of there and forget the whole dumb idea of playing spy .\nnobody screamed .\nmy last move brought the edge of the rug a finger width past the edge of the opening and i blinked at the light .\nset for flight , i peered through .\nin the lamp glow at the table the two women bent over an assortment of crockery , their attention fixed on what they did .\nthe wall that separated us was in deep shadow .\nober dropped a pinch of powder into a bowl .\nafter carefully opening a small container , she let some liquid drip on the powder .\nit flared .\nthe room filled with yellow smoke that looked like the smoke created by the magician of thunder .\nthat trick had n't impressed kovat or tarvik .\nhow did she intend to use it ?\nwith a fingertip she drew a triangle on the tabletop .\nif she touched it with anything other than her finger , i could n't see what she used .\na red glowing line followed her touch .\nin the center of the triangle she placed a bowl filled with a dark powder .\nmaking odd hand motions above it , she mumbled a chant .\nthen she took a part of the powder and measured it into a shiny object she held in her palm .\nwhen she stepped back from the table and reached toward alakar , i saw what the object was .\nober had put the powder into a small ornamental locket that hung on a chain .\nslipping the chain over her daughter 's head , she arranged it carefully around her neck .\nthe little locket hung like a jewel , shining against the dark fabric of alakar 's robe .\nit is done , ober said .\nare you sure it will work ?\nalakar asked .\ni know my part well enough if you remember yours .\ni wish we were rid of them both now , alakar said .\nwhat use would that be ?\nuntil we receive word of kovat 's death , we can not proceed .\ntime enough then to wed and rule , my girl .\ni strained so hard to catch their words it was a miracle they did n't feel my presence and hear my heart banging away .\nthey also did n't continue their discussion .\ninstead , the conversation turned to the usual , empty chatter about jewels and robes .\ni waited , shivering and silent , until they blew out the lamp , before i let the rug slide back into place .\nreceive word of kovat 's death ?\nafter the dim light of the room , the passageway was thick blackness .\ni felt my way along the wall until i reached its end .\na pressure on the spot above the door where tarvik had touched the rock accomplished nothing .\ni touched it again , to the side , then above , then below .\nhad he tricked me ?\nhad he raised his hand to mislead me , then touched some other stone , the stage magician thing of watch my right hand so you wo n't see what my left hand is doing ?\ni had barely been able to see what he did .\nbut why would he try to mislead me ?\nhad he guessed i would return this night ?\nwas i an idiot to believe anything he told me ?\nwas he waiting now in his room to hand me over to ober 's guards ?\nfrantic , i felt around the rock 's edge , searching for the latch stone .\ni could stay here until daytime when ober and alakar left their room and then , if i had n't frozen to death , i could climb through their wall opening .\nbut where would that get me ?\nguards must constantly patrol the corridor beyond their door .\nor i could return to tarvik and tell him what i had overheard .\nand how would i explain why i 'd decided to spy on his aunt and cousin ?\nhe said he trusted me , which could be useful , and , wow , would my turning up now put paid to that idea .\nmy fingers touched a smaller stone , set slightly deeper in the wall , and almost at the point i had thought tarvik touched .\nDorea was trying to cook a Baklava. When she took it out of the oven, the Baklava was ruined as the bread was not crispy, and the filling was bursting all over the pan. At that moment, her daughter came home and noticed her mom's fresh yet ruined Baklava. She tasted it and gave a thumbs-up to her mother.\ni pressed it .\nthe door opened .\nso he had not tricked me and my suspicions were unfair .\nnot much consolation there .\nit meant tarvik really did trust me more than i trusted him , which put me in the unpleasant position of knowing i did have an obligation to help him .\nhate being obligated , because in my experience , being in some guy 's debt is never a good thing .\nchapter 12 have i mentioned that a thousand years ago , when i was sixteen , i dated rock decko ?\nrock in black leather and chains was , uh , hot .\nand i was sixteen .\nwhich i hope explains why i thought he was hot .\nhe was n't much older than me , two or three years , i think .\nrock was into motorcycles , worked in a cycle repair shop , and really , really , really wanted to be a bad boy but had no special skills .\ni am talking fighting skills .\nhe could n't possibly have held his own in a hell 's angels type of dust up .\nso he hung around the edges when bikers came into the shop , soaking up their wild stories and believing them , then putting himself into the lead role .\ni can still hear him telling me , babe , this dude came at me , had a knife this long , thought i 'd back off , blah , blah , blah .\nhe had me fooled for about a month .\ni was really impressed in that teenage nuts way .\nwere n't you scared ?\nnah , babe , nothing scares me .\ndid i mention he was a really good kisser ?\nsixteen is easy to impress .\nfortunately , he did n't own a car and neither of us had a room to go to or money to rent one and had n't figured a path around that little obstacle .\nalso , fortunately , rock had n't yet been tapped to be a wizard .\nmost smash wizards do n't know they are wizards .\nit is n't genetic , at least not where i come from .\nit 's more accidental , like discovering you 're a natural on the oboe .\nand that happens when a music teacher hands you one and says , i think you might be good on this .\nwith wizard mentality , the line is , do you sometimes wish for something and are surprised when it happens ?\nrock and i were a twosome before his big moment .\nwhile necking in the back booth of the pizza parlor , because necking on a bike is really hazardous and i have a few scars to prove it , i 'd come up for air and tell him about my astrology training , some of it with the local astrologer , some with my gran .\nyou can tell fortunes ?\nhey , can you pick winners , you know , like for a seahawks game ?\nverboten , every astrologer knows that , not because it is illegal but because one teeny error can earn you a lifelong enemy , so i told him of course not .\nthat is n't why we broke up .\nanother guy tried to hit on me , nothing obnoxious , the sort of thing i could have turned off with a polite , that 's my boyfriend over there .\nrock did n't give me a chance .\nthe guy touched my arm , just touched , did n't grab , and asked my name and could he buy me a beer .\ni was on my way back to the booth from a rest room run .\ni did n't even get a chance to tell him i stuck to diet coke because even in mudflat they card .\nthe bad boy wannabe saw us and flew out of the booth swinging a chain and then there was this messy bloody mix-up , with the owner tossing us all out into the parking lot .\ni left and headed home .\nbuses stay clear of mudflat at night .\ni had to walk .\nlots of time to think .\nsure i was n't a brain but at least i knew a violent boyfriend could be a girl 's worst nightmare .\ni told him so the next time he phoned .\nfunny thing , that .\nhe did n't argue , did n't say he was sorry .\ni heard later that some other girl helped scrape him up off the parking lot pavement where mr .\npick-up turned out to be the tougher of the two .\nand so i put rock decko out of my mind .\nsure , when my cousin jimmy introduced me to darryl decko , six years later , i mentioned rock .\ndarryl said , my half-ass brother ?\nsorry you 've met him , honey .\ni do n't have anything to do with him and he 's not crazy about me , either .\nand i was dumb enough to believe him .\nafter the decko boys , and a list of guys in between , is it such a surprise that i avoid letting myself be indebted to good looking young men ?\nthe troll is a different story .\nand speaking of the troll , old lor was about as attractive and therefore , yes , i trusted lor .\npeeking out around the edge of the doorway , i saw it was still night-black .\nno one guarded the long wall on this side of the castle .\ni closed the stone door and moved in the building shadow toward the trees .\na shadow separated from the others .\nmy breath stopped .\nold lor whispered , this way .\ni hurried to him and whispered back , we heard ober send you away .\naye , but i waited .\nwe circled around the back of the temple , past the stables and up the other side , watching from the far wall until we saw that no one stood near the gate except two temple guards .\nyeah , tonight there were two of them .\nhad the guards decided that themselves ?\ni did n't know what their rotation was so maybe this was routine , something they did when there were others around .\nmaybe they did n't like ober and company any more than i did .\nwhen they opened the gate for me , their torches lighting my way , i glanced back and saw the silhouette of ober 's manservant across the hill , a tall form of hood and narrow cloak .\ni had n't had time to do his horoscope and i did n't much want to because i had seen the evil washing through ober 's heart and that was enough .\nlor was right to lead me to the gate .\nnow no one would suspect secret entrances .\nthey might wonder how i had left tarvik 's room and slipped past them , but this was not their castle .\ni doubted they knew every exit .\nthey would figure there must be a door from his room to an adjoining room , with that room opening to a different corridor .\nor they would believe i was magic .\nthat 's the most useful thing about superstitious people .\nthey are easy to fool .\noh right , a policeman once said something like that to me about fortunetelling .\nnance waited for me , wringing the hem of her tunic in her hands and blinking back tears .\nshe sputtered complaints about the lateness of my return , then touched me and sobbed that i was chilled through and would probably come down with fever .\nafter wrapping a blanket over my cloak and pushing me down among a pile of sheepskins , she pressed a cup of hot tea into my hands and insisted it would warm me .\ni sipped at it , wishing it was coffee , brandy , even their bitter mead , almost anything other than tea .\nwhen she settled down , i told her what had happened .\nit sounds to me as though tarvik suspects we also have a secret door , probably because he does , nance exclaimed .\nbe careful , stargazer .\nif he ever discovers our way through the stables , we will become prisoners in this temple .\nhe trusted me with his secret .\nis n't that worth something ?\nwho can be sure of tarvik ?\nhe is safe enough now but someday he will rule and marry alakar .\nthat will change everything .\nthose who rule do not remember their friends .\nthink of kovat .\nhe prayed with the priests of thunder until the daughter of the sun cured him .\nthen he was quick enough to turn against them .\nthose who did not escape fell beneath his sword or died in prison cells .\ntell me more about this daughter and her consort .\ndo you remember them ?\ni remember them , but it was long ago .\ni was a child when they died .\nthey were both kind to me .\nnance , do you know how she cured illness ?\nhow did she cure kovat ?\ni only know what i have been told .\nfifteen years ago the daughter and her consort arrived here from the afterworld , from the home of the gods .\ni was an infant .\ntarvik was four .\nhis mother had already died , as had my mother and father .\nkovat lay on his deathbed .\nwhen the daughter saw him , sheoh , it is so long since i have heard this tale , let me think .\nyes , she lay her hands upon him and prepared a drink for him and the fever left him .\nhe knew then that she possessed great magic .\nabout what i 'd guessed .\nshe gave him a swallow of tea or mead or whatever , probably used to wash down a dose of antibiotic .\nnance added , no one can do that but a god .\nnow tell me what ober said .\nand what she did .\ni told her what ober said .\nneither of us was sure what she meant .\nas for what ober did , i knew of only one person who could explain that .\nnance , is there some way we can speak with the magician of thunder ?\nspeak with him ?\nfirst you request a secret meeting with tarvik , now you want the same with the magician .\nare you mad ?\ni need to talk to him .\nhe might know what sorts of tricks ober uses .\nknockout drops ?\npoison ?\ni do n't know much about drugs , but some are made from wild plants .\nwe need to tell him what i saw ober mixing and find out what it is .\ncan he be brought here ?\nnance did her drama queen thing , flung herself back against her pile of sheepskins and tossed her head from side to side , exclaiming , life was so easy for me before you came , stargazer .\ntarvik did not suspect me .\nober 's guards did not watch me .\ni went where i chose when i chose .\nand no one ever asked me to invite a magician to the temple .\nstargazer !\nhis eyes hold terrible magic !\nokay .\ndo n't give it another thought .\ni gave her my widest smile .\nif it is you and me that ober wants to be rid of , and those were her words , i will patiently await my fate .\nnance jumped to her feet .\nher small fists beat the air .\nyou are terrible !\nwicked !\ni can not think why i listen to you !\noh , have your way .\nbut if the magician 's eyes turn my heart and mind forever against you , it will be what you deserve .\ndo n't look at his eyes , girlfriend .\nlet me talk to him alone .\nand who will keep him from killing you ?\nwhy should he kill me ?\nwhat would it gain him ?\nno , we 'll give him something he wants .\nbesides freedom , what would he want , nance ?\nsomething i can hand him ?\nfood and , oh , i can not believe i am planning this with you !\nit is madness !\ni can not allow it !\nwhile nance moaned and sobbed and shouted her opinions of me , i went outside and heated water over the courtyard fire , carried it inside , washed away the day 's dust , and then dried myself with a linen altar cloth .\nby the time i pulled on a clean tunic and rubbed most of the water from my hair , nance was almost calm .\nnot screaming anyway .\nshe no longer shouted .\nshe merely glared at me .\nyou win , she said .\ni can think of only one way to do this and when kovat returns he 'll punish us all .\ni will send word to tarvik to order the magician brought to us .\nwill tarvik do that ?\ni will not ask him as his cousin .\ni shall command him as temple priest .\ni shall say the magician holds knowledge you must have to complete the task kovat set for you .\nclever you .\nbut let me make one change .\nnance clapped her hands over her ears and cried , i do not want to hear it !\ni said it , anyway .\nin the back of my addled brain an idea grew .\ni needed to know more than what the magician might say in the presence of nance and tarvik .\nnance , i do n't want the magician brought here .\ninstead , tell tarvik to have his guards escort me alone to the magician 's cell .\nher howls of protest should have kept me awake , but it had been a tiresome night and i tuned her out .\nher howls were nothing compared to tarvik 's anger .\nthe next day we spent an unpleasant afternoon stuck in the stale-smelling temple with tarvik .\nnance had made me don temple robes , again , so i felt about as grouchy as he acted .\nhe could hardly believe my request , much less consider granting it .\nyou want to see who ?\nhave you gone mad ?\nhe said .\nthere were a whole lot of hard truths i was tempted to shout at him .\nbut nance was right .\nif i was going to get my way , i had to let her win through intimidation .\nfor someone who did n't know that phrase , she had the behavior down pat .\ntrouble was , for all i knew the guy loved alakar , or lusted for her .\nhey , he was nineteen and the girl was gorgeous .\nthat bit about not wanting her was ober 's thought , not mine .\nhe tended to treat me like a pet , picking me up to toss me on his horse , tucking in my hair so it would not be noticed , fastening my cloak when i looked cold .\noh yes , he liked to hug me , and probably any other available female , and might have progressed to grabby if i let him , but it was nothing more than flirting .\ni knew that .\ni was entertainment , amusing him with my reactions to his teasing .\ni speak for the daughter of the sun , nance chanted for the third time .\ntarvik glared .\nhe had left his guards in the courtyard , as requested , and entered dressed in his temple garb of fur-trimmed cape and gold armbands .\nin his out thrust hands lay his offering , a gold trinket cradled in a soft new temple cloth .\ntoday the cloth was another one of the linen ones i loved .\ni did n't have much use for jewelry in the middle of the olympic mountains , but clean towels ?\ndefinitely included on my want list .\nthe silk ones served nance 's hobby nicely but were useless when it came to drying my hair .\nnance ignored his offering .\nthe daughter rejects all gifts from those who refuse her small requests .\nhow can i know this is truly the daughter 's request ?\ntarvik demanded .\nthe daughter sent me a vision of the magician speaking with the templekeeper , nance chanted .\ndo you question my visions , son of kovat , faithful servant of the daughter ?\ntarvik thrust out his lower lip .\nwe waited .\nat last he said , what if the magician harms the templekeeper or - or anyone ?\nmy father 's anger will be toward me .\nnance repeated the answer i had given her .\nif he could do harm , he would have escaped by now .\nthe daughter knows the courage of brave tarvik exceeds the powers of the magician .\nof course we won .\nwe knew we would .\nhad we argued with tarvik in the courtyard , dressed in tunics , our faces unpainted , he might have held out against a cousin and a stranger .\nbut here in the musty shadows of the hanging lamps , overseen by the portraits of his father 's gods and faced by two fully costumed priests of the daughter , he could drag his feet a bit , but had to give in to nance 's demands .\nwish i could have had such power over the magician .\nwith a pouch of food hidden under my cape , i followed an escort guard back to the castle , then through a creaking metal gate , then down a winding stone staircase into the damp smell of basement .\nbacked into his cell , the magician faced me with the defiant hatred of a captive who knows where to place the blame .\nas the guard closed the door behind me , i began to doubt my judgment .\nwhy had i thought i could gain information from this man ?\ni had outdone him in front of a powerful warlord , taken his one chance at freedom .\nhis gaze followed mine around the cell .\nnot pretty , is it ?\nsoon kovat will tire of you , too , and you will find yourself entombed in a like place .\nmold sketched odd patterns on the stone walls .\nlight filtered through a grate far overhead .\nthe cell , a man 's height in width and depth , was beneath a courtyard of the castle , reached by twisting narrow stairs and foul-smelling corridors .\nthe magician had no comforts of sheepskins or bench , only the earth floor , cold and hard beneath his body at night .\nremembering the bribe , i drew the pouch of food from the folds of my cape and held it out to him .\nhe accepted it , his bony fingers curling like talons around it .\ni waited while he ate the cheese .\nthe bread he concealed beneath his tunic before handing back nance 's pouch .\ni accept your gift but i owe you nothing in return , he said .\nwhatever you give me , you give to protect yourself , i said .\nwhy is that ?\nyour life depends on kovat 's whim .\ni can probably gain a favor or two from him .\nonce in command , the lady ober will have no use for me .\nthen you 'll lose me as your one chance out of here .\nwhy should you help me ?\nit was you who destroyed me .\nno .\nno , i did n't .\nyou destroyed yourself .\nyou did n't have good answers for kovat 's questions .\nmy words were brave enough but i still was n't going to look in his eyes .\nhypnotism is funny stuff , nothing i have ever understood or been willing to try .\nit can be shot through with bad magic .\nwhat is it you want ?\ni saw something i hope you can explain to me .\nwhy should i do that ?\nbecause i do n't know what is planned .\nmaybe the overthrow of kovat 's son .\nmaybe the destruction of all of us .\nhe squatted in a corner and turned his face to the wall .\nhunched up , his thin hands and feet protruding from his tunic , he looked old and sick and defeated .\nthis matters not to me .\none ruler will entomb me , another will behead me .\nwhere is the difference ?\na quick death might be easier .\nis there nothing i can offer you ?\na way out , he whispered against the stones .\ni 'll do what i can when kovat returns but there 's no way to help you escape now .\nhe glanced up .\ni turned my eyes away .\nwould you help me if you could ?\nin return for the right information , why not ?\nyour captivity is no use to me .\nand that was true .\nhe was a weak , weary old man , separated from friends and home .\nif let go , he would disappear into the mountains .\nhe 'd want freedom far more than revenge .\ni could tell you how to free me .\ntrue , i wasnt scared of a sickly old man , but what about kovat when he returned ?\nif he discovered i had helped the magician escape , and kovat had an unpleasant ability to know exactly whom to suspect of what , what would happen to me ?\nwhile i worried that through , i nodded .\ngo ahead , tell me .\ni could tell you the contents of drugs to add to the drinks of the guards that would make them sleep through any sound .\nyou could steal past them and release me .\nand when they woke up they could hack me to death .\nmake your own choice .\nwhatever you want of me must be paid for with my freedom .\nthe guard rapped his sword hilt against the outer surface of the cell door .\ni called to him to wait a moment longer .\nthen i told the old man what i had heard and seen in ober 's chamber .\ni know her magic , he said .\ni know those signs and powders she uses .\nwhen i am out of this place i will tell you what it means .\ntell me quickly and i will try to get you out .\nlater will be beyond caring , dark woman .\ni am weary to the brink of death and you have not much longer .\nnow i will tell you how to mix the drug to overcome the guards .\nmake your choice when you wish .\nbut if you hope to save yourself , you had better choose soon .\nwhat ober mixes can be fatal .\nshe learned from a deathwalker .\nhe had barely time to tell me the leaves i must grind and simmer and add to a drink for the guards .\nfirst , grinding coffee beans is the limit of my culinary skills .\nsecond , his mixture might be deadly .\ni think we both knew i was n't going to do it .\nthe guard knocked again , opened the door , and said it was time to leave .\ni had no more than returned to the temple courtyard when nance attacked me with questions .\nwhat did he do ?\nhow did he speak ?\nwhat are the cells like ?\ndid he cast a spell on you ?\ndid he tell you what you need to know ?\nwill he help us ?\ni described the prison cell with its shaft of light entering through the ceiling grill .\nshe clapped her hands and exclaimed , yes , i know where that is !\nthe grill opens to a small courtyard so the guards can check on the prisoner from above .\ndid he tell you what you sought ?\ni told her his bargain .\nnance shrieked , clapped her hands over her mouth and stared at me , her eyes wide above her crossed fingers .\nhe said tarvik 's life lay in ober 's hands .\ndo you believe him ?\nis he lying to gain his freedom ?\nif you help him , you will destroy yourself , stargazer .\npromise me you will try no such madness .\ni nodded .\ni 'm not suicidal .\nfor now we were safe enough .\nand who could know what might occur .\nmaybe my suspicions were wrong .\nbetter yet , maybe bad weather would change kovat 's plans and he would return before ober attempted whatever she was up to .\nnance , what exactly is a deathwalker ?\ni asked and waited patiently for her to go through her usual series of screams and threats after which i added , the magician warned me against the deathwalker .\nthe magician ?\nthe magician said that ?\noh stargazer !\nso tell me , what exactly is a deathwalker ?\ni do n't really know .\ni only know the tales lor tells .\nsome say that man can kill you with a touch .\nsome say he is already dead .\nsome say his soul is gone , that he traded it to an evil god .\nnone of her explanations matched anything i knew about .\nthe magician of thunder was little more than an old man with a few stage tricks .\nso probably the deathwalker was also overrated , a man who once murdered someone under odd circumstances , creating rumors about himself .\nwhile nance fussed around me , i drew a circle on a tabletop .\nas i did not know an hour , all i could use was the day kovat had given me .\nthat meant placing the sun on the morning horizon of the deathwalkers chart and hoping it showed a message from that spot .\ni knew from memory the placement of the slower planets .\ni added them .\nafter what i had felt in ober 's chart , i did n't want to do his horoscope and certainly i did n't want to touch it .\nnance leaned against the table .\nwhat do you see in your magic circle ?\nnothing much , little more than i saw in the charts of erlan and kovat , but then , this one not only lacks the moon and near planets , it lacks the placement of time .\nyou sound like my chants .\nyour meaning is clouded .\nit is , i sighed .\ni hoped for some clear message but there is n't one .\nturning to look at her , i dropped my hand to the table for support .\nwhen can we get out of these robes ?\na shock of cold ran through my hand .\ni stumbled back .\nstargazer ?\nyou look pale .\nare you faint ?\ni stared at the circle .\nthe sun .\nhis heart .\ni had touched it .\nnothing but cold , i whispered .\nyou 're cold ?\nshall i make you some tea ?\nno .\ni did n't know what to tell her , disbelieving what i felt .\nnot the pits of the earth , not the swirling horror of ober 's heart .\nsomething worse .\nslowly , not wanting to do it at all , i reached out my hand and pressed my palm over the sun in the deathwalker 's chart .\nit 's cold , his heart is a piece of ice .\nthat 's no surprise .\nnotice how the other guards avoid him ?\nhe is wicked , that 's certain , and i think they fear him .\nworse than that .\ni continued to press my palm to the table .\nif i had not felt the cold i would have thought there was simply nothing to feel .\nthis business of heartbeats baffled me .\nyet i felt them every time i touched the sun in a horoscope .\ni had felt the pounding of erlan 's heart , the lighter rhythm of the hearts of ober and alakar .\nhis heart is frozen .\nnot cold , frozen .\nno heartbeat , no pulsing , nothing .\nand that means ?\nwhat does it mean , you tell me what it means when a heart does not beat .\nher eyes widened and she paled .\ni told you , stargazer , i told you .\nthe man is dead .\nhe has no soul .\nand his heart no longer beats .\nwhich is why he is called a deathwalker ?\nnance shrieked , i hate this !\ndo n't tell me more !\ni do n't want to know !\nshe ran out of our rooms and back toward the altar room , and while i stood staring at the circle , i heard her banging around with the candlesticks .\ni waited .\nshe calmed down enough to return .\nwe have to warn tarvik .\nober mentioned kovat 's death .\nit may be only a wish on her part , but still , tarvik needs to know .\nhow can he beware of an unknown danger ?\ni shrugged .\ndistance , maybe .\nhe could make himself unavailable ?\navoid her and stick close to his guards ?\nimpossible .\nguards could protect him from an attacker with a dagger , but magic ?\nalso , tarvik must dine with his guests .\nhe can do no less as host .\nhad n't thought about the etiquette among the unwashed .\ncould he pretend to be sick and stay in his room ?\nif ober seeks to harm him , that would give her an opportunity .\nshe could claim to bring him healing potions and instead poison him .\ni do n't think she wants him dead until he 's married to alakar .\nbut she might have a potion to make him obey her .\nmaybe he needs you or me at his side to slap his hands if he tries to drink stuff he should n't ?\nor better , we claim the daughter wishes us in attendance to cure him with our constant prayers ?\nshe moaned .\nhow easily you expand the duties of the temple .\nand how is tarvik supposed to know your plan ?\nhow about i go secretly tonight to warn him ?\nnot without me .\nafter considerable arguing i was forced to accept , once again , this kid could at times be stronger and more stubborn than myself .\nwhat would tarvik think , after showing me the secret door and telling me he trusted me , if i popped up in his room from the passageway entrance and brought along nance ?\nno one knows of this passage , not even my father , he had said , and put my fingers on the touchstones so that i could use the passage .\ni trust you , he had said .\nif i was not so sure ober planned to damage the guy , i would never break that trust .\nnow i had to balance his anger against my fear for his safety .\ni told nance , he is going to hate me for this .\nbut that 's better than letting her drug him .", "Subject":

restraints when she was thrown aboard immediately before takeoff .\nher knees were bleeding through torn pant legs from the brutal way shed been dragged from the car .\nmost of the blood covering her was from steve harris , when they pulled her across his body .\nthe ambush had worked perfectly , with both the lead and following cars destroyed by rpgs ( rocket propelled grenades ) , trapping the

for the celebration .\noh , you and i are going to have our own celebration .\nhe signaled his men who wrestled with her to tape her arms behind her back and tied a heavy canvas bag over her head .\nshe fought and could hardly breathe as they threw her into the baggage compartment .\npeter in motion he tried calling the embassy , but the commercial phone lines were overloaded .\nhe needed to do something anything to help , so he called cybil to pick up the envelope .\nen route , josh called him , okay , boss , heres all we know right now .\nthere were three vans and a total of 10 guards ,

metro station where cybil asked to meet .\nit was easier than trying to get peter through cia security .\nshe was standing by the curb , wearing a tan wool coat against the cold wind blowing from the east .\nhe signaled for her to get into his explorer .\nshe climbed in , handing him an envelope and fastening her seat belt .\noh , peter , im so sorry .\nthanks , cybil .\nill take you back to

on the message , so this will be viral .\nhis head was throbbing , look , mike .\nthanks .\nill see you later today , as soon as i can get there .\nhey , one more thing .\nyour buddy stokes .\nhes already on his way here too .\npeter had enough to worry about without concern for john and carolyn .\nin the meantime , gates came into his office with some papers .\nhere you go , peter , orders to support the texas guard in el paso .\nyoull report admin-wise to light colonel marian colson , but the orders say you have direct tactical control under the director .\nthanks , colonel , this is super .\nhow about transport ?\nim working on it , you get home and pack .\nill have you outbound before youre done .\nroger that , sir .\nand , peter .\ngood luck , son .\ngates extended his hand .\njailed rachael hit her head on the bulkhead as the plane hopped on landing , bruising her shoulder .\nafter some fast turns , the pitch of the engines resonated from inside a hangar before shutting down .\nher bare feet were unbound , but her hands were tied behind , and the bag on her head was soaked from exhaling for several hours .\nshe was hurt and exhausted when the door was opened and she was jerked to her feet .\ntwo men gripped her upper arms as she stumbled down the unseen stairs from the plane .\nboth shins were scraped and bleeding .\nthey threw her onto the rear seat of a car , which started to move immediately .\nother than engine smells inside the hangar , there were no sensual or visual clues about her location , although within seconds , she could feel the heat of sunrays coming through the windows .\nmen were talking in the front seat , but she didnt understand them .\nthe car made several turns , initially , then drove at high speed on a straight course for a long time .\nthe seat smelled moldy and didnt provide much isolation from ruts in the road .\nat the speed they were travelling without stopping , she assumed they were on some kind of major highway .\nshe had no way to gauge time , but it was at least half an hour .\nscared , exhausted and injured , rachaels apprehension increased when the car slowed , turning abruptly before stopping temporarily while someone exited , leaving the door open and the engine idling .\nshe could vaguely hear the metallic sound of a chain and creaking gate opening .\nthen the person returned to the car and they drove a short distance before stopping .\nthe door by her feet opened , and she was pulled by her ankles half way out before her legs were dropped onto the pavement .\ntwo men grabbed her roughly , pulling her backward and upward , forcing her to walk before she was balanced .\nwithin minutes , she was thrown into a jail cell where her bindings were cut free .\npushing up from the dirt-crusted floor , she was able to sit and remove the bag over her head , throwing it violently .\nher eyes adjusted to the small adobe cell with rusted bars at one end .\nthe door was open , and a dark evil-looking man in a rumpled suit stood alone , staring at her .\nhe had an amused look on his face .\ngood day , miss aston .\ni trust you had an enjoyable trip ?\nwho , who are you ?\nwhere am i , and why am i here !\npadilla didnt answer her questions directly .\nwho i am is not important , but let us say that you are in my care at this old abandoned federal prison , somewhere in mexico .\nwhy you are here is a bit more complicated .\nyou people are insane !\ni assume youre with that lunatic cardenas , and you know who i am .\nthe man stood erect with his hands folded in front , oh , yes , we know who you are , and , soon , the whole world will see you on tv .\nwhat !\nwhat do you mean ?\nfear overtook her .\noh , you will see .\nfor now , enjoy the comforts of our hospitality .\nim hungry and need to clean up !\nall in good time .\nall in good time .\nhe pulled the old steel gate closed with a loud clunk .\nshe looked around at the space , no larger than her bedroom closet .\nit had a filthy old cot and a sink and open toilet with no seat or running water .\nsitting on the very edge of the thin decayed feather mattress , she imagined all the microscopic creatures inside .\nthe room was void of anything else and hadnt been cleaned in decades .\nat least there were no snakes .\nafter a few moments alone , however , fear gripped her as she remembered how billy ware was murdered in front of the whole world .\nsuddenly , nothing mattered .\nshe thought about peter .\nhe must be going crazy .\nreturn to action look , carolyn , im going back to help peter , thats all .\nher face was streaming tears , john , youre not well enough , and youll get killed .\nhe loved her so much .\nhe stopped packing and held her , look , sweetheart .\ni dont know what we can do down there , but its for rachael .\nyou wouldnt like me very much if anything happened to her , and i sat here on my ass .\nlook .\nim more fit than ninety percent of the police and military , so i cant hide behind some supposed disability .\nbesides , i owe peter my life , and he couldnt live without her .\ni know , i know .\ni want her back too , but you guys are not the ones to do it .\nexhaling and looking down , she shrugged , youre also the best guys to save her .\nhe tossed his bag over his shoulder , kissing her passionately .\nhug the girls for me .\ni got ta run to the airport .\nshe followed to his truck .\nyou need to wash this thing .\nstarting the engine , he said , yeah , when i get back .\nill call tonight .\ni love you .\nin washington peter called gates after packing his gear and clothing .\nall right , peter , you need to get over to andrews asap .\ngot a c38a from the ang ( air national guard ) on standby .\nthanks , colonel .\nill get you a sitrep once i know whats going on .\nen route to the air force base , he called ltc marian colson to let her know he was coming .\nshe said someone would meet him .\nthere was a misty , chilly rain falling and a slight wind , but the traffic was unaffected .\nthe trip to andrews took only forty minutes , and the plane was waiting at the ang hangar .\nit was already preflight checked and fueled .\nit took less than five minutes after peter boarded for the engines to reach temperature and start the takeoff roll .\nthe c38 is a militarized version of the gulfsteam g200 , produced under license by israeli aircraft industries .\nit can fly at over 500 miles per hour at 45,000 feet .\nits all-weather range is 2700 miles .\nonce airborne , the plane banked left sharply to course 260 degrees , while passing through 5000 feet .\nonce on course , the pilot engaged the autopilot and announced , sir , weve got a slight headwind , so the computer is showing three hours twenty to touchdown .\nthat should put us on the ground just before 1400 local .\npeter moved aft to the vhf secure command radio console away from the flight crew .\nhe contacted arng headquarters , this is major shields , requesting phone patch , over .\nmajor shields , on whose authority are you using this comm frequency ?\nover .\nltc colonel gates at hq , over .\nafter a few moments the operator replied , ah , roger , major .\nwhat do you

cybil , this is peter shields in an air force plane heading for el paso , over .\nhe un-keyed the mike .\noh , hello , peter .\ni wasnt expecting a radio call .\nhe waited a few seconds , ah , cybil ,

security forces squadron terminal at biggs army airfield , fort bliss , el paso , the same specialist that met him before was waiting .\nhe tried to take peters bag again , but was refused .\ncolonel colson wanted to meet you here , sir .\npeter nodded while listening to his cellphone messages .\nthey walked inside where colson was using an unoccupied office .\nwelcome back , major .\ni wish it was under more pleasant circumstances .\npeter was in civilian clothes so didnt salute .\nthanks , colonel .\ni guess im destined to be in el paso more than my own office .\ntake a desk in any open

kidnapping .\nokay , sure .\ntake the squadron room down the hall .\nits not in use today .\ngreat .\nthanks .\noh , and , peter , major , please step into my office .\nshe had a subdued look on her face .\nwhen he entered , she closed the door .\nlook , the news just reported that cardenas is going to broadcast something at seven oclock tonight .\nhe says its in revenge for his fathers death .\npeter looked at her helplessly , any chance he doesnt mean rachael ?\nhe doesnt have anyone else important alive that we know of .\nexcuse me .\ni need to make some calls .\nhe rushed from her office to the squadron room and closed the door .\nhis first call began ringing , stokes .\njohn , its peter .\nwhere are you at right now ?\njust landed at el paso .\ngood .\nget your gear and come to bliss , the security squadron .\nroger that , major .\nill be there as quick as i get my gear .\nshields out .\nhe then called the number he had programmed into his phone from cybil .\nthe message was a male voice without identification , leave a message .\npeter stood upright as though he was addressing the director in person , sandy vitale , this is major peter shields .\nyou need to call me immediately , reference sandcastle .\nhe then went to a computer terminal and did some on-line shopping using his credit card .\nhe then asked colson to have her driver go to a sporting goods outlet to pick up his order .\nhe listed several more tactical items from the armory on a piece of paper , asking colson to provide .\nback in the squad room , he called another special number at macdill , afb , in tampa , florida , and asked to speak to u.s. army special operations commander , lt. general robert gardner , who answered moments later , major shields !\nhow are you , peter ?\nim fine , sir , but i have an urgent request to ask .\ngo ahead , major .\nif weve got it , youll get it .\nsir , are you aware that a u.s. government intelligence director was kidnapped in mexico today ?\nwe heard about it , peter .\nwe also heard a familiar name , rachael aston .\nyes , sir , theyve got her .\nwhat you probably dont know is that theyre planning to kill her publically , on youtube tonight .\nthe general knew peter from his former days as a special forces operator at macdill , and knew rachael by reputation after the chicago counter-terror operation .\nhe also knew what she meant to peter .\npeter , what do you need ?\nthey discussed his thoughts about an operation in mexico , and then his phone beeped from another incoming call .\nthe general understood peters request and signed off .\nthis is shields .\nthe man on the other end spoke cautiously , uh , yes .\nthis is sandy vitale .\ni believe you called me .\nyes , director .\ni need to talk to you about rachael aston .\nare you insane , major ?\nthis is an open line , and ill not discuss anything remotely related to the company .\nlook , sir , i dont want to threaten you , but ill blow the whistle on you , if i need to .\ni dont have any idea what youre talking about !\nhow about land in la paz ?\nhow about your meeting with hector cardenas as a congressman ?\nthere was a long pause .\nhow dare you !\nlook , i dont know who you are , or what you think you know , but this call is over .\nthen so is your career !\npeter held his breath not knowing if vitale would continue or hang up .\nafter several seconds and heavy breathing in the microphone , vitale said , what is this about ?\nits about rachael aston .\nshe was kidnapped today .\nyes , yes .\ni know that .\nwhat has that got to do with me ?\nit has everything to do with you .\nshe works for you .\nyou sent her to mexico .\nfor all i know , you tipped off the cartel .\nhow dare you talk to me like that !\nill tell you how , you pompous son-of-a-bitch !\nyou took a bribe of land in mexico from jamie montes when you were a congressman .\nyou also met secretly with cardenas when he was an illegal student in college .\nyou cant prove any of this !\npeter didnt have anything but rachaels letter , wan na bet ?\nor put it differently , wan na take the risk ?\nthis is all fabricated bullshit , major , and youre going to get court-martialed .\nwont be the first time , asshole .\nbe my guest if anything happens to her .\ntheres nothing i can do about that !\noh , yes there is .\nso , are you through playing games ?\nwe

dont want me as an enemy , trust me .\nso , shut up and listen .\nthere was a pause .\nokay , im listening .\nraiders stokes arrived as the call with vitale was ending .\nthey embraced , and peter invited john into the squadron room that had become an operations center .\nthey talked a little about johns tearful goodbye with carolyn and about peters plans so far .\njohn , weve got a lot of pieces to put together and not much time .\ndo you know where shes at ?\nno , thats the biggest problem .\nbut , i think i can find her , if we have the time .\nremember your old buddy commandante padilla ?\noh yeah .\ndo we get to see him again ?\nive got some courtesies to return .\nhes our link .\nhes got to be involved .\nif we can get him at home or his office , then we have a chance .\ncardenas could have rachael anywhere .\nwe cant cover enough ground with the time hes giving .\nim working on that .\nthe plan went together quickly , but it would be dark , after sunset that night before everything was ready .\npeter and stokes were constantly on the phone and internet .\nin the late afternoon , peter called vitale again , but the call went to voicemail .\ndamn him !\nhe slammed the table with his fist , then his phone rang .\nthe display said it was vitale .\ndamn , you , i said to keep the phone close , and dont miss my calls .\nstokes was listening to only one side as peter continued , i dont care about your excuses .\nthere is nothing more important .\ndo you hear me ?\njohn couldnt believe peter was talking to the top intelligence official in the country .\ndid you get the information i requested ?\ngood .\npeter began writing .\nstokes smiled , then peter spoke to vitale , now , listen very carefully , because you now have rachaels life in your hands , and its a life i value above all things .\nthink of it as her fate is your fate .\npeter listened for a moment , shut up and listen .\nyou need to call cardenas , and get this stopped or stalled long enough for us to get to her .\nafter listening again .\ni dont care if you havent spoken to him in years .\na pause , then call padilla .\ni dont care how you do it !\nyoure the cia for christ sake .\nmake the call , and stop the excuses !\nas i said before , im holding you responsible .\nstokes cringed before peter continued , consider it a promise .\npeter shut off the call .\nwhat an arrogant ass !\nno wonder hes in politics .\nrock and roll sunlight dimmed rapidly over the mountains .\nby five , peter and john were dressed in desert camouflage uniforms ( dcus ) with backpacks , water camels , body armor , sincgars radio , gps , medical supplies and weapons .\ncolson had done an outstanding job cutting through red tape .\nthey had the intel they needed and were waiting for their ride .\nwithin minutes they heard the whispery sound of the experimental s-97 high-speed scout and attack aircraft as it landed : the new design is half helicopter and half turbo-prop conventional aircraft .\nthe coaxial-rotor system uses two stacked counter-rotating blades on top of the fuselage and a five-blade rear pusher propeller to carry troops silently at more than 250 miles per hour then deposit them without a runway .\nthe small experimental version only had room for two soldiers and equipment .\nit was designed using classified stealth technologies .\ngeneral gardner had convinced the manufacturer in arizona to loan the plane to the cia , which was assuming responsibility for the operation .\nthe pilot was a factory test pilot volunteer with more than five thousand hours flying combat helicopters in the active army .\nhis name was chief warrant officer steve perry ( u.s. army retired ) and he was excited to be called to action .\nhe excused himself to use the mens room and stretch , while the soldiers loaded their gear aboard .\nwith only ten minutes on the ground , the assault team was cleared for takeoff by air traffic control through bliss and across el paso commercial air space , staying below 2000 feet .\nat this altitude , they were silent and invisible in the moonless sky .\nperry wore night vision goggles ( nvgs ) , flying around the outskirts of juarez to gps coordinates provided by shields .\nelsewhere , sandy vitale closed the door to his office and scripted the discussion before dialing the phone .\nhe really didnt know cardenas , and when they had met years earlier , he was a congressman , not the head of the cia .\nhis first call was to juan padilla .\nhola .\nyes , i would like to speak to juan padilla , please .\nthis is commandante padilla .\nwell , commandante , my name is sandoval vitale .\nim with the american cia .\nyes , mr. vitale .\ni am honored by your call .\nyes , commandante .\ni am calling because i wish to speak to mr. hector cardenas .\ni was told that you would know his phone number .\npadilla was silent for several seconds .\nsi , seor vitale .\nof course , i do not have the phone number of mr. cardenas .\nbut you do know how to contact him ?\ni have talked to him in the past when examining some matters .\nlook , mr. padilla .\nit is a matter of national urgency for me to speak to him .\nwhose national urgency ?\nexcuse me .\nthe u.s. security .\nin that case , seor , i am pleased to assist you .\nif you will give me your telephone number , i will make some calls , and maybe mr. cardenas will oblige you .\nyes , well , all right .\ntell him we met many years ago when i was in congress .\ni would like to speak with him as quickly as possible ( he gave the number ) .\nyes , seor , sure .\ni will try hard to get your message to him .\nthank you for calling .\npadilla hung up before vitale could speak more .\nhe thought , so it begins , the americans want to bargain .\nalmost an hour later , near the hour of rachaels execution , cardenas called vitale .\nhello .\nthis is hector cardenas .\nah , hello , mr. cardenas .\nhow are you today ?\nim fine .\nis this a social call ?\noh , ah , no .\ndo you remember meeting me ten years ago ?\ni remember meeting you .\nsi , si .\nyou were in congress then , and now you have the whole cia .\nah , yes .\nthats me .\nlook , seor vitale .\ni am a very busy man tonight .\nwhat is this about ?\nabout ?\noh , well .\nmy associates in government heard some news stories that you would kill ms. aston at seven tonight .\nyes , it is all arranged .\nseveral of my men are going to enjoy her body first .\nit should provide quite a long bit of entertainment , if you understand me ?\nah , well .\nthats what we need to discuss .\nno !\nwe need to discuss nothing .\nyou call me assuming i care to talk to the great cia .\nwell , i do not care .\nyou see , i am more powerful than you , or my government in mexico .\nyes , well .\ni do respect your position there , but please understand how we might react .\nms. aston is no ordinary citizen .\nshes a senior government executive .\nthe u.s. government will not tolerate such action .\nhow will you stop me ?\nvitale didnt have an answer .\nlook , mr. cardenas , what do you want to stop this ?\nhe smiled at the thought of the cia begging .\ni want my father back alive .\ni want my money for the drugs captured at what you call smugglers ridge .\ni want to live in peace and not worry every time my shipments cross the border .\nif you give me all this , then i will spare ms. aston .\nlook , be reasonable .\nyou know i cant do these things .\nyour father is dead .\nyes , my father is dead !\nyou people killed him .\nnow it is my turn .\nlook , there must be something ?\ncardenas was tired of the dialogue , and it was time to set up for the execution .\nokay , mr. vitale , i ask your government for one billion dollars .\nyou must pay tonight by ten oclock in mexico city .\ni will make the announcements of the delay .\nbut ... good day !\nresistance the men congregating outside rachaels cell were the ugliest humans she had ever seen .\nthey glared and joked at her .\nshe sat on the cot and stared away from them at the wall , trying not to show emotion , although fear was overwhelming her .\nfast footsteps down the hall signaled something happening , when hector cardenas yelled something to the others .\nhe pushed his way past and opened her cell .\ngood evening , ms. aston .\nyou really do look terrible .\noh , you are still a beautiful woman , but fear is not becoming on you .\nrachael wanted to say something , but he had total control , so she remained silent .\ni had a chat with your mr. vitale .\nhe is a weak person .\nshe remained silent .\ndo you know what we have planned ?\nyou see these men ?\nthey have a hard life , so the mexican women dont like them very much .\nwhen you came to this old federale prison , they became very excited .\ni told them that each could have you as his own toy tonight before they kill you .\nyou will be a movie star , a dead porn star after your first movie .\nso sad .\nbut , your mr. vitale , he is trying to bargain for you , and i have asked for him to get only one billion dollars , so that i wont kill you at ten oclock tonight .\nwhat do you think of that ?\nhe was standing next to her as she turned her head .\ni think youre shit , and ill enjoy watching you die .\nhe slapped her hard , knocking her to the floor where she covered her face , silently whimpering .\nyou will show respect in front of my people .\nholding her face , she screamed , go to hell !\nshe feared he would unleash his dogs at that point , but he left her cell instead , locking the gate .\nit was reassuring , knowing that the creatures were momentarily outside the locked bars .\ncoming neither soldier had flown at such speed this close to the ground before .\nthe s-97 had a completely enclosed front and rear cockpit for streamlined operation .\nthere was mild wind noise , but the flight was otherwise quiet , in eerie contrast to the throbbing torque from the 1500 horsepower turbo-shaft engine , radiating through the hull .\nit was difficult to see land features , but occasional lights on the ground showed a breakneck speed reference .\nover the intercom , the unseen pilot in front said , ten miles to touchdown .\nthey had organized everything at bliss and were already wearing almost everything .\nloose items were gripped firmly as the plane slowed and descended in one controlled transition from flight .\nthe pilot came on again , once on the ground , crouch low , the blades on this thing are only slightly above head height .\nill secure the bubble then depart back to base .\ncall me for pickup .\npeter responded , thanks for the ride , chief .\nwell call when ready .\nroger that .\nthe plane settled quietly in a small clearing .\nthey hardly realized it was on the ground .\nopening the side-lifting window , a vortex of desert dust enveloped them .\npeter jumped out , and stokes handed loose gear , then jumped down himself .\nthe pilot was standing nearby to latch the door with a gloved hand over his nose and mouth to shield against the dust , patting them each on the shoulder before climbing back into the cockpit .\nwithin seconds , they were moving through the brush in darkness , completely silent .\nthey crouched low as a car passed on the nearby dirt road .\npeter , said , its only about a half klick ( half a kilometer ) from here .\nroger that .\nboth were wearing tactical headsets , and the military sincgars radio was inside peters pack .\nthe brush raked against them , depositing small spores and barbs as they jogged around cactus in the partial-moon light toward the lone ranch home .\npeter didnt expect padilla to be home , but hoped someone would know where he was .\nhe would do anything tonight to get information .\na hundred meters away from the house , peter signaled to stop and kneel .\nlight wind blew through the sage as he whispered .\nokay , john .\nlast time he had guards front and back , but i got around them , so watch for more now .\nyou take the front and this side .\nim going to reconnoiter the back and far side .\nstokes nodded , roger .\nbe careful .\nhe gave a thumbs-up signal then disappeared into the night .\nstokes moved to the edge of the brush about fifty meters from the house .\nhe was positioned closer to the rear corner and could see partway down the back of the house .\nit was dark , but someone lit a cigarette showing two men sitting on the porch .\nhe then moved into position to view the front and identified two more men .\nhis earpiece sounded , stokes , come in .\nstokes here .\ni ident four sitting , two front , two back .\nconfirm .\nstokes replied , roger .\nconfirm also two by two .\npeter came back , lets get them sitting .\nyou take front , ill take back -- on my mark .\nroger that .\nsimultaneously , both rangers moved slowly to the sides of the house .\npeter went toward the rear corner and stokes to the front .\ntiming was important .\nthe wind noise helped them move undetected .\nstokes whispered , in position .\npeter replied , prepare to engage .\nthis signaled stokes to cock his weapon .\nthe distance both needed to cover from their respective corners to the sitting guards was about thirty feet , a little over one second away .\nready .\nmark !\npeter stepped from the corner walking fast directly at the two men .\nhe switched on his gun light , which was fastened to the barrel with velcro straps .\nboth men were startled , and one fell backward in his chair , while the other reached for his automatic rifle .\nhe yelled , dont move !\nhe didnt care if they understood the language , they understood the instruction .\nthe fat man who fell tried to roll and grab his gun , while the standing man glared , frozen in place .\npeter momentarily focused the light beam directly in the face of the down man , i said , dont move !\nthe standing man then made a move for his weapon , and peter fired twice into his upper body , and then aimed back at the down man who covered his head with his arms .\nthe man who was shot stood motionless for half a second before falling to his knees , trying to grasp something unseen to break his fall .\nhe slumped face down on the patio deck .\npeter couldnt be sure how badly hurt the man really was , he hadnt been able to aim .\npeter signaled the fallen fat man who was now whimpering something in spanish , to get up .\npeter assumed the down man was dead , but shot him again in the back of the head , not wanting any surprises .\nhe called stokes .\nare you clear ?\nclear .\ngood .\nbring them to the rear .\nroger .\nabout a minute later , stokes rounded the corner following two mexicans , with their hands behind their heads .\ngood work , striker two .\nlooks like you had a little more trouble than me .\nyeah , that one wanted to be a hero .\npeter ordered two men face down on the ground and put one in a chair , while stokes guarded the others .\nthe man sitting was the fat one that had fallen over .\nhe was still whimpering as peter forced him to sit next to the bloody corpse .\nhe stood in front of him with his m4 aimed at the mans face asking , where is padilla ?\nthe man was shaking uncontrollably , no sabe , seor , no sabe !\npeter rocked forward within a foot of his face , padilla !\ntell me , or join your friend in hell !\none of the men on the ground spoke , he does not know , seor .\nel commandante , he does not tell us this .\nwell , then .\nyou are all worthless , so i will kill you now .\nwait !\nwait !\nplease , seor .\nwe can tell you .\nstokes was looking at peter in disbelief .\nhe had never seen him ready to kill in cold blood .\npeter responded with his gun aimed at the talker on the ground , tell me what ?\nspeak now , or you will never talk again .\nplease , seor .\njefe padilla is coming home .\nputting his foot on the mans back and resting his gun muzzle by his ear .\nwhen ?\nwe do not know .\nhe was to be home soon after his work .\nwhere is his work ?\nthe man on the ground next to the talker gave a warning in spanish , and peter stomped his combat boot hard into the back of his neck , temporarily paralyzing the man .\ni said , where is his work ?\nplease , seor , we do not know certainly , but he had miguel , que descanse en paz ( rest in peace ) , take him to the old part of federale prison , 'centro federal de readaptacin .\nit is located in almoloya de jurez .\npeter told the man to stand , while stokes pushed the fat man from the chair back to the ground .\ntell me about this prison .\nit is very old , from the time of francisco villa .\nwhen is he coming here ?\ni do not know .\ni swear !\nhe said after some work at the prison .\npeter could guess at the work .\nhe ordered the man back down and stokes to guard them .\nhe prayed that his cellphone would connect through one of the towers in el paso .\nhe stepped out of earshot from the guards and dialed the number .\nthis time , vitale answered on the first ring .\npeter demanded , tell me what happened ?\nvitale spoke nervously , look , major .\ni tried .\ni really tried .\ncalm down .\ntell me what happened .\nwell , he wont stop the execution and the other things .\nwhat other things ?\nvitale couldnt speak for several seconds , hes having his killers do things to her , before ... you worthless shit , didnt you get anything !\nmajor , he agreed to hold off till ten oclock .\nthats all .\nwhy ten ?\nbecause .\nbecause he thinks i might get him a billion dollars .\nwhat !\nhes ransoming her ?\nwell , no .\nhes playing a sick game .\nwhat game ?\nhe knows i wont get the money .\ndid you try ?\ndont be ridiculous .\ntheres no one in government that would approve that !\nlook you spineless wimp , you try .\nand , you get me more time !\ni know where shes at .\noh good .\nwe can call the police .\nthe police have her , you moron .\nnow get me more time !\nwhat if i cant ?\nthen say your prayers , because im coming back to washington !\npeter ended the call , hoping fear would work in his favor .\nit was only a couple hours before rachael would be dead -- or worse .\nreturning to stokes , he started to say something when they heard a car driving down the dirt road toward padillas ranch .\njohn , keep these guys quiet , im going out front .\nive got em .\nbut be careful , peter .\npeter was gone .\nas he neared the front corner of the house , the car slid in loose gravel , stopping with a dust cloud encasing it and swirling in the headlight beams .\nthe driver exited in the fog and walked toward the house yelling , renato , angel , dnde ests ?\nhe was another fat man in a poorly pressed suit coat , dnde ests ?\nwith no reply , he pulled a pistol from his shoulder holster and crouched painfully , trying to look through the front windows to the back .\nhe moved in peters direction .\nmidway to the corner , peter stepped from the darkness , drop it !\nthe man started to raise his weapon , and peter shot a short automatic burst , hitting him in the stomach and throat .\nthe man dropped his gun and fell to his knees holding his neck before rolling over .\npeter took careful aim and shot him again in the chest , and then walked toward the car .\ninside , padilla strained over the front seat , trying to put the car in reverse .\npeter shot both front tires then moved beside the car .\nseveral bullets were fired from inside the car , shattering windows , but all missed , as peter returned fire with an automatic burst through the front drivers window .\nthis scared padilla , who threw out his gun .\npeter yelled , get out of the car !\nget out now !\nthe rear door flew open on the opposite side , and peter moved around , aiming at padilla .\na quick check of the car showed no more occupants .\nup against the car !\nhands on the roof !\nspread your feet !\npeter kicked padillas feet farther apart as he patted him down , careful to check for an ankle gun , popular with police .\nhe spun him around , pressing his rifle below his chin , major padilla , how good of you to drop in again .\nremember me ?\npadilla was petrified , and peter smelled urine .\nhe roughly pulled padilla in front of the car , into the lights , throwing him in the dirt .\npadilla tried to regain some balance on all fours , but peter kicked him onto his side .\npadilla put his hands in front of his face in a reflex action .\npeter yelled , look at me !\nlook good !\nim the last face youre going to see on this earth .\nstokes was still in back , unable to see anything in front except rippling shadows in the headlights shining through the darkened house .\npadilla defiantly tried again to roll onto his side when the gun blast ripped through his right elbow .\nhe fell screaming onto his back cradling his severed arm when peter fired another burst , exploding the right knee .\nstop crying , or you lose the other leg and arm !\nyou apparently didnt take me seriously last time .\npadilla cried , please !\nplease , seor !\nno more !\nwhy are you doing this ?\nwhy ?\ni have done nothing to you !\npadilla was bawling hysterically .\nthats not important .\nits important what you will do .\nanything !\nanything !\njust let me live !\nremember our little game ?\nnow think about your left knee .\ni have several magazines of ball shot ammunition that im going to use , first cutting off your remaining leg .\nno !\nno !\ndont do that !\ni will do anything please dont shoot me again .\nplease !\nwheres rachael aston ?\ni dont wait !\ni will tell you !\ntalk fast .\nhe was standing over padilla , aiming at his remaining leg .\nshe is with cardenas at 'centro federal de readaptacin .\ngood .\nhow do we get in there ?\nbe careful how you answer .\nyou can not .\nonly i can get you in .\nhe moaned and began rolling around grasping his arm .\nblood loss from cut vessels in his leg caused padilla to hallucinate .\npeter grabbed his shirt collar , what about your guards ?\ncan they get in ?\npadilla was going into shock , saying weakly , no , no .\nthey can not ...\nwhich gate should i use ?\nwhich gate !\npadilla was verging on blacking out , no gates .\nwalls are meter thick ...\nhe lost consciousness .\npeter left him bleeding in the dirt , and ran around back where stokes was guarding the others .\nstokes asked , what happened ?\ni heard a lot of gunfire , not all yours .\njust a little tussle with your mexican friend , but hes in hell now .\nwhat time is it ?\nits after nine .\nwe got ta go .\nnot much time .\nwhat about these turds ?\npeter flipped back to full automatic , but stokes yelled , peter !\nwe cant waste these guys !\nthats murder .\ncall it justice for all their victims .\nwe cant ...\nthe machine-gun burst cutting through the row of men was startling .\nall screamed .\npeter !\nhe responded , just some leg wounds .\ncome on .\nwe got ta go !\nstokes didnt feel any sympathy for the wounded men , who had done much worse to their victims .\nthey jogged back into the brush for the rest of their gear , where peter used the radio to call el paso .\nraven , this is strike team , over .\ngo ahead strike .\nraven , over .\nraven .\nneed pickup at point bravo , over .\nup in one , strike .\nstand by for pickup in six , over .\nraven , get ops working on coordinates to an old juarez federal prison , the central federal readjustment prison .\nroger that strike , out .\nthey gathered everything and ran up the road to the turnout used by guy during peters prior visit to padilla .\nprison vitale had never met peter , but knew his background from press reports he found online .\nhe was overtaken by fear now that peter was in a rage and somehow knew his darkest secrets .\nhe needed to do something , or his career would end and probably his life .\nhe dialed the last number called , and cardenas answered immediately , ah , my friend mr. vitale .\ndo you have my money ?\nno .\nno i dont , but you better give up now , and let ms. aston go !\nwhat , and miss all the fun !\nim about to make a home movie for the world to enjoy .\nits called a snuff movie .\nim sure you will enjoy it .\nlook , we know where you are and are coming to get you , so you better stop what youre doing and give up .\nthat is not in my nature , seor .\nbut thanks for the tip .\nadios .\nbut wait ... fifteen miles south of el paso , the s-97 settled cautiously in the darkness .\nunable to see through the dust swirling everywhere , peter used his gun light as a beacon .\nthey could hardly breathe as the pilot turned on the interior lights .\nthey were airborne in less than twenty seconds .\npeter asked the pilot over the intercom , got vector ?\ngood to go , strike .\ngreat .\nat the prison , cardenas moved quickly down the stairs , walking fast to the cell block .\ntwelve men stood from the floor when he approached .\nhe ordered several to get to the prison entrance .\nrachael sat upright , startled by yelling and men running .\ncardenas opened her cell door , and two men ran in , grabbing her and pulling her through the opening .\nrachael screamed and kicked forcefully , but never got balanced before being thrown onto the floor .\ncardenas was yelling at another man who manipulated camera and lighting equipment .\nshe tried to crawl , but one of them grabbed her feet and then ripped her blouse open .\ncardenas clubbed him , yelling spanish obscenities .\nthe man backed away as the cameraman continued to test lighting .\nin the air , peter and stokes were rechecking their gear and looking out the side plexiglas door onto a moonlit landscape .\ntheyd been in the air only three minutes when the s-97 pilot reported , the prison is in sight , strike , dead ahead .\npeter commanded , chief , do a fly-around .\nthere were no lights in the huge rectangular building , which was surrounded by weed fields , empty gun towers and rusted barbed fencing .\nokay , john , heres what i see .\nour best chance is to get on the roof .\nyou take position on the end by all the cars .\nim going inside .\nstokes replied , roger that .\nive got seven full mags .\nhere , take these .\npeter handed him three more .\nif i need more , ill need you inside anyway , but youll probably have a lot of squirrels leaving the nest , once im in .\nas the plane settled quietly in the center of the roof , stokes said , sounds cool .\nlets rock this house !\nyeah !\nhow often do we get to break into prison !\nboth jumped clear before the plane disappeared straight up into the blackness .\ninside , rachael sat curled on the floor , not able to look at the lights , as cardenas began giving directions .\npeter ran across the roof looking for an entrance , but all roof doors were padlocked .\nmoving to the edge of the building , he took a rope from his pack , along with all remaining ammunition , and rappelled down the side of the four-story building .\nat ground level , he could see interior lights in one section .\nmoving along the wall , below window height , the first door ahead was standing open .\ndeep inside , cardenas stood over rachael , now , my beauty , the fun will begin .\ni hope you entertain us .\nhe moved back to a computer that had video feeding from the camera .\nshe looked at him defiantly , but said nothing as he walked backward , barking instructions to the three men with him .\nthey attacked together , ripping at her clothing and pressing her to the floor .\none man struggled in the excitement to lower his pants .\nshe thrashed , but the man on top was too heavy and smelled like unwashed feet .\nhe was fat , unshaven with bad teeth and greasy hair , and hadnt bathed in days .\npeter moved cautiously in the dark until he heard her scream .\nhe ran toward the sound , as she cried out , repeatedly .\nhis adrenalin was raging as he ran down a dark hall , toward the light .\nshe screamed again !\nhe turned the corner about fifty feet behind the mob scene .\nhis footsteps had been masked by rachaels pleading and the men yelling , cardenas yelling the loudest .\nshe was pinned to the floor by two men , with another on top .\nshe fought as men jeered and hooted .\ncardenas was looking through the camera display , and no one saw peter take careful aim at the man on top , firing one shot into his head .\nthe body jerked violently then collapsed on top of rachael .\nat first , the other men cheered thinking the attacker had climaxed prematurely , but then they saw his shattered skull .\nthey released her , as she screamed and pushed at the limp corpse .\none man tried to rise as peter fired a burst at him , hitting him at least once .\nthe second man tried to roll away , but collided with the opposite cell bars .\npeter fired a burst at his back without aiming .\ncardenas threw the camera and tripod at peter then ran toward the far end of the corridor .\npeter ignored him , running to rachael .\none of her attackers was crawling away as peter pulled the dead one off of her .\nas the mexican tried to stand , peter raised his m4 with his free hand and fired a burst , again without aiming , downing him for a second time .\nrachael clung to his left leg as he turned toward the other wounded man trying to pull upward on the bars only five feet away .\nhe was shot , but still moving .\npeter fired several times into his back and head .\nhot brass shell casings pinged off the floor around her as she gripped tightly , burying her face in his pant leg .\nmen ran toward them from the direction cardenas had taken .\nhe lifted her and felt another surge of rage looking at her tattered underwear and bloodied body , rachael , sweetheart , we got ta move fast !\nshe showed renewed strength , as she pushed up to her feet , while peter took aim down the hall .\nrun that way !\nhe pointed to the darkened hall from where he had entered .\nshe was hurt , but she ran in bare feet for the darkness , stumbling on hot shell casings , while peter knelt , waiting .\nstokes couldnt hear the gunfire inside , crouching in the dark behind the roof faade , when suddenly the massive ground-level door burst open below and several men ran to the cars .\nhe didnt see a woman and held fire .\ninstead of fleeing , the men were grabbing weapons from cars and several began running back toward the prison .\nhe switched to automatic and aimed down into the moving horde , firing a full thirty-round magazine fanning left and right .\nit was impossible to aim as he ducked , reloaded and reengaged over the wall .\nthis time , several men , behind the cars , fired back , and he dropped below cover again .\nhe moved left about twenty feet and visualized where the muzzle blasts had been .\nswitching to semi-automatic , he rose quickly and fired where the flashes came from , exposing very little of himself .\nhe counted three men firing from the parking lot below .\nthere were also some casualties lying on the dirt by the door , but others had made it back inside .\nwhen rachael rounded the corner away from peter , he stood and started to run in the same direction .\nhearing the security door behind them creak open further , he turned and fell prone , strafing the end of the corridor .\nhe then flipped to semi-auto and took aim at a muzzle flash in the smoky haze , as bullets ricocheted off the floor and walls near him .\nhe squeezed off four shots until the shooting stopped .\nhe remained still , waiting .\ngun smoke filled the corridor , but he could see several men down .\nmost were moaning , and some struggled to rise .\nstokes was pinned down , but safe , kneeling behind the thick concrete of the roof faade .\nhe keyed his head-mounted communicator , peter , come in .\npeter was set to voice activation , go ahead .\ni got some , but some went back in with weaps , over .\nyeah , i got a few , not sure if all .\nrachael is heading out the side .\ncan you get to her ?\nover .\nis your rope still in place ?\nover .\nyes .\non my way .\nstokes put his spare magazines in his leg pockets , then sprinted to peters pack .\nthe side yard below looked quiet , so he rappelled down and moved to the door about fifty feet away .\nit was dark , and he peered inside , moving swiftly into shadows .\nshe was whimpering nearby .\nrachael ?\nrachael , its john .\nhe heard her feet shuffling closer , but she didnt say anything .\nher arms flew tightly around his neck , and he could feel her quivering almost-naked body clinging to him in terror .\nrachael , wheres peter ?\nshe released and pointed to the lighted corridor .\nthere .\nlook , honey .\nive got to help peter .\nshe released her grip and followed behind him as he moved toward the light .\nthere was no sound , but there was a strong smell of cordite .\npeter , its stokes .\ni have rachael .\nhold .\nim coming your way , john .\nstokes remained still .\npeter rounded the corner .\nive got them pinned .\nlets get her to the roof for extraction .\nroger that .\npeter took a covering position as john grabbed her upper arm and led rachael to the courtyard .\nwere clear peter .\nill cover .\npeter ran toward the door , where stokes knelt outside aiming past him .\nno one followed .\npeter said , get her to the roof , john .\nyou climb , then pull her up .\ni cant peter .\narms arent strong enough to climb .\nill cover .\npeter looked at him for a moment , then patted his shoulders and ran with rachael to the rope .\nrachael .\nill go up first then send down a harness to pull you up .\nshe jerked her head up and down but still didnt speak .\nit took him several seconds to scale the wall .\nhe pulled up the rope and tied a double loop at the bottom for her legs , dropping back down .\nstep into the harness .\nas he pulled upward , she was able to push with her feet , helping him .\nshe still had remarkable strength as adrenalin flooded her body .\nstokes fired three shots and moved to the edge of the door for more cover .\nrachael came over the wall showing good agility , and peter quickly dropped the rope again .\njohn , come up now .\nhold one .\nhe fired several more rounds , then ran to the rope .\npeter handed his m4 to rachael .\nhoney , you cover us .\nshe screamed , peter !\ni dont know how ...\nhe looked at her and said calmly , just lean over and point toward the door .\nif someone looks out shoot !\ndont worry about hitting em .\nitll keep them inside .\nshe moved to his right with a clear view over the edge at the doorway below .\npeter struggled to pull stokes up .\neven with johns legs helping , the lift was almost twice rachaels weight .\nstill , he was up quickly .\nrachael had fired several times .\npeter pulled the sincgars radio from his pack and keyed the microphone .\nraven , come in .\nraven here , over .\nraven need extract , last location , expedite , expect fire , over .\nroger .\nstand by , over .\nout .\nthey moved to the center of the flat roof taking opposing cover positions .\nrachael stayed between them , trembling in the cold desert night .\nthe temperature had nothing to do with her chill .\nshe said nothing .\nlong seconds passed before the s-97 appeared overhead .\nrushing to open the rear hatch , the soldiers helped rachael get inside and belted in .\nthe pilot ran around the front of the idling aircraft with ten extra magazines .\npeter said , thanks , ace , get them out of here .\nive still got some work to do .\nstokes yelled .\nhell no , you dont !\nnot alone !\nrachael screamed .\npeter !\n-- as the hatch was locked .\nthe rangers moved away , and the plane disappeared .\nSimon, an amateur painter, had been working on a portrait of his deceased pet for over a week. After he finally completed it, he stepped back and immediately noticed that he had painted the wrong color for his pet's fur. Just then, his wife saw it and exclaimed, \"That's exactly how I remember him!\"\nwhen all was quiet , stokes said , man .\nyoure pressing your luck our luck .\nbuddy , i appreciate your help , but you dont need to do this .\nhey , im the guy with the bad shoulders , and someone needs to pay .\npeter patted him on the knee , good man , lets go .\nsafe the pilot reached behind his seat , waving a headset , which she took .\nms. aston , theres an extra flight suit under the seat by you .\nshe was still dazed and hardly aware that she was in her underwear .\noh .\noh , thanks .\nno problem , maam .\nhe was smiling to himself , having enjoyed the view , when she climbed aboard .\nhe was unaware of the ordeal shed endured .\nit was dark in the plane , but after releasing the seatbelt she was able to find the suit and struggle into it .\nshe was still shaking , thinking of the smelly monster that peter killed , clawing at her .\nshe was glad they all died .\nin the ambush in mexico city , steve had begged , and they had shot him for no reason .\nshe was glad when cardenas men were killed .\nshe wanted them all dead .\nit only took a few minutes to cross the border and arrive at ft. bliss .\nthe pilot spoke into the headset , maam , were going to land now .\ncolonel colson will meet you and take charge .\nim staying with the plane to get our boys back out .\npeter !\nhe and john were still with those madmen .\ngod , why did they stay ?\npeter , i need you now !\nmarian colson opened the hatch and helped rachael step out of the airplane .\nshe seemed less like a colonel and more like a woman than any other time .\nlet me help you , dear .\nlets get you patched up and pretty .\nrachael felt weak .\nthanks .\nworried cardenas hid in an upstairs office without lights , not knowing where his men were , or if the danger was over .\nhe dialed his cellphone .\nmr. vitale !\nwhos this ?\nhector cardenas !\nwhat do you want ?\ndo you have my money ?\nno , there is no money .\nwell , we had some visitors tonight .\nwere they your men ?\nnot really , just some other good americans .\nyes , its the american way .\nnow you see , they have taken my prize , and i am going to find them all and kill them .\nthey killed some of my men .\ngood .\nless shit to send down the sewer .\nnow , mr. vitale , there is no need to be coarse .\ni want to bargain with you .\nhows that ?\nwell , you see .\ni dont know how many you sent , or where they are right now .\nthis worries me .\nso , you call off your dogs , and ill assure that none are killed .\nwell .\nill see what i can do .\nvitale didnt plan to do anything .\non the roof , peter and john discussed options .\nstokes was pumped .\nlets go get him , peter .\nno .\nhes expecting us .\nim sure he has an army coming .\nwe need a different plan .\nairborne sometime later , cardenas had dozens of men search the prison from roof to cellar before feeling it was safe to move .\ntwelve men were dead and a dozen more wounded by the americans , and he had lost rachael aston .\nthe americans would pay ten times over !\nwhen he learned that padilla was also dead , he knew it was time to move farther south , away from the border .\nhe ordered an escort to the airport .\nseveral men surrounded him as they ran to his limousine .\ntwo guards got into the car with him and he ordered the remaining guards to follow them in their own cars to the airport , about twenty minutes away .\nonce at his hangar , the pilot was waiting for him .\nhe had inspected the plane and had it fueled .\ncardenas ordered an immediate takeoff .\nhe didnt feel completely safe until his plane was airborne .\nthe night sky was bright with stars as they rose above the low cloud cover .\nhis temples throbbed and he told one of his body guards to mix a pain reliever with his scotch .\nthe affect was almost immediate , as he reclined in the soft goatskin-covered luxury seat .\nhis eyes closed , and he was soon dreaming .\nthe vision of rachael aston , submissive , pleading under his control , nearly naked , caused him to smile .\nit was not the vision he had expected to film , but she was still fun to watch .\noh , well , there would be more .\nthere was turbulence while the plane was climbing , but it was peaceful at cruising altitude , as the plane headed due south , toward mexico city .\nhe always enjoyed the mexican vastness , which was his in many tangible ways .\nhe felt a sense of tranquility .\nhe relaxed for the first time in hours and felt his eyelids grow heavy .\nsuddenly , there was a loud interior noise as the luggage compartment door slammed open .\nshields and stokes jumped out , with m4s leveled at the two body guards who first looked at cardenas , unsure what to do .\nhe screamed something , and the guards hesitated momentarily before reaching inside their jackets .\nthe american gunfire inside the narrow cabin was deafening , as the two lifeless guard bodies slumped in their seats .\nthe pilot yelled something from the cockpit , and the plane dropped momentarily , before he regained control .\ncardenas face was distorted by fear as he raised his hands in submission .\nhello , hector .\npeter moved toward the man paralyzed by rage , as stokes checked the body guards .\nboth were dead by several shots in the chest ; their eyes remained fixed .\ncardenas screamed , what is this !\nthis is my plane .\nyou can not be here !\npeter smiled , oh , but we are here !\ncardenas slumped and lifted his chin in defiance as the rangers moved quickly to restrain him with belts and shoe laces from the dead mexicans .\nnow , were going to take a little trip together .\nstokes guarded cardenas as peter went forward to the cockpit .\nthe pilot was armed but showed peter his gun , without attempting to use it .\npeter instructed him to turn toward el paso , which the pilot obeyed immediately .\nback over juarez , peter used the planes radio to call el paso control , clearing the way for a direct flight into the main airport with hector cardenas aboard .\nonce cleared to fly over the border , cardenas was blindfolded and gagged .\nthe rest of the flight was uneventful , ending the reign of terror .\npeace hours later , peter had been resting his head on his forearms , leaning against the railing of her hospital bed .\nhe needed rest , but wasnt leaving her .\nshe was sleeping with two ivs , one for fluids and one for antibiotics .\nshe looked fresh and beautiful with clean hair and only minor scrapes and bruises visible above the pure white sheets .\nthe nurses had been especially attentive .\nshed slept for hours before her head nodded .\nafter a moment , she said , peter ?\nhe looked up and stood , stroking her hair .\nhi .\nhow are you doing ?\nshe licked her lips .\noh , ive felt better .\nyou look good all cleaned up .\nhe was dressed in civilian clothes .\nrachael , youre gorgeous .\nshe looked around asking , what time is it ?\noh , around daybreak .\nthe nurse said youd be out for a while with the antibiotics .\nshe reached both hands to his arm , pulling him down to kiss .\nthank you .\nthank you and john .\nhe spoke softly , still caressing her head , hell be here , after some sleep .\nyou can thank him then .\npeter , i was so scared .\nher eyes watered as they embraced .\nits over , rachael .\ncardenas is in jail in el paso .\nyou got him ?\nyes .\nwe got him .\nhes cozy in u.s. custody .\nthank , god !\nthat monster !\nshe looked away and started to cry .\nsweetheart , he cant hurt you anymore .\nshe clutched his hand and pulled him down again , wrapping her arm around his neck with a firm grip .\nshe couldnt talk .\nrachael .\nyou need to rest and not worry about him anymore .\nill be here with you and wont leave .\nshe lay back with a peaceful expression and started to doze again , under the influence of the drugs .\nhe sat down beside her , finally allowing himself to relax .\nhe hadnt slept for two days , and his eyes were heavy .\nhe smiled lightly and started to doze off when she opened her eyes as he was drifting toward sleep .\npeter .\nah , yes ?\ni want you to propose again .\nabout the author frank perry has

the double glass doors of the gordos chain restaurant .\nthe sign , which by law appeared in the entranceway of every gordos fast food establishment , warned that merely breathing the air of the restaurant ( the word restaurant , also by federal law , was required to appear in quotes whenever used to refer to a gordos ) was equivalent to consuming a 400 calorie meal for every thirty minutes spent on the premises .\na helpful grid outlined the various diseases patrons could expect to suffer after stays of increasing duration .\nat the one hour mark , adult-onset diabetes was likely .\nafter two , heart attack was virtually guaranteed .\nthe chart stopped at three hours , thirteen minutes , for no one eating at a gordos had yet managed to remain on the property longer than that , unless resting in the ambulance in the parking lot also counted .\nso noted a duly engraved asterisk .\nthe customer in the purple shower curtain had ignored the sign and was now resting comfortably in his mobility scooter at the order counter , trying to catch his breath .\nhe pointed at the grid of letters and numbers with one thick hand .\nmccc7700 ?\nhe asked .\nthats the meatball , cheese , cheese , and cheese meal , sir , said the teenager behind the counter .\nwhat about mcccc9900 ?\nmore cheese , sir , but otherwise identical .\nand the shl4802 ?\nthe customer asked .\nthats our shovel of lard , said the teenager behind the counter .\nthat .\nill take that , too .\nyes , sir .\nwould you like to artery surprise that for just twenty-five cents more ?\nyes , said the customer in the shower curtain .\nand i want some extra buckets of heart thunder .\nyes , sir .\nadditional sauces are extra , sir .\ngeez , what a rip-off , the large man said , wheezing .\nokay .\nill pay it .\nof course , sir .\nbehind the man in the shower curtain , a small pack of scooter-going customers revved their electric motors anxiously .\nthis patrons breakfast order had taken ten minutes to compile , thanks to the new menu grid at the front of the restaurant .\nnew changes in food service law had gone into effect that morning , requiring the gordos chain ( and every other fast food restaurant ) to post the calorie counts for their meals .\nthe problem was that there was only so much space on the grid .\ngordos management had made the decision to abbreviate the meals next to their four-to-six digit calorie numbers , which left the menu looking like the nasdaq ticker .\nyour order is sixty-three , sir , said the kid behind the counter .\nyou can pick it up over there .\nhe pointed to the order-pickup window three feet away .\ngeez , said the man in the shower curtain .\nits way over there .\nsweating and complaining , he directed his scooter to the area indicated .\nonce there he put his hand on his chest while he waited for his breathing to return to normal .\nthen his eyes widened .\nsir ?\nasked the teenaged employee .\nare you having a stroke ?\nthe kid reached under the counter for a stroke coupon , good for a thirty percent discount during a subsequent visit .\ni forgot my drink , said the man in the shower curtain .\nadd a diet coke , of course , sir .\nthe kid paused , then handed the man the coupon anyway .\njust in case , sir .\nmore loudly , he said , may i help the person whos next ?\na second , then a third mobility scooter jockeyed for position .\nthe breakfast crowd was heavy this morning .\nthe florid , sweat-covered patron wearing matching 7x under armor sweatpants and workout shirt had just opened his mouth to order when a rope snaked down from the drop ceiling above him .\nas the first man on the first scooter , the kid behind the counter , and the other customers watched in open-mouthed amazement , acquiring high blood pressure as they inhaled , several more cables appeared .\na quintuplex of ninjas climbed silently down the cables , brandishing swords and nunchucks .\nwelcome to gordos , said the kid behind the counter .\ntheres a line , you know , said the man on the scooter .\ngaaaaakkkkkkk , said the kid behind the counter , who had just been stabbed through the face with a ninja sword .\nplease dont kill me , said the man in the shower curtain .\ni havent eaten yet .\nthe silent killers went about silently killing the not-so silent restaurant customers , beating and slashing and chopping at them .\nthe man in the shower curtain slapped his scooters controls , only to find his battery was dead .\nhe tumbled from the scooter , collided with the floor , and slid across the polished tiles exactly as quickly as mayonnaise also does not , oozing across the recently mopped surface with his shower curtain trailing behind him .\none of the ninjas walked calmly around him to head him off .\nthe man in the shower curtain looked up as the ninja raised his bloody sword .\nthe enormous grille of a humway assault vehicle tapped the ninja gently on the shoulder .\neven when it is not touching you , there is something imposing about a humway assault vehicle .\nit looks like nothing so much as a grizzly bear riding a shark while both are carried in the talons of a mighty eagle , if the shark is also humping a dumpster and the grizzly bear has two enraged elephants for hands , if all of that was , you know , a truck .\nand when it does touch you , the most playful nudge from an eight-thousand-pound humway feels a lot like having your internal organs ruptured as your spine is crushed and your body is thrown through the air by the impact , because that happens .\nas the humway crashed through the wall of the gordos , the ninjas heart crashed through the wall of his ribcage and his brain crashed through the wall of his skull .\nthe ninja puree that landed wetly on the floor next to the fat man in the shower curtain was still holding its sword when duke manfist climbed from the drivers seat of his vehicle .\neverybodys under duress , he announced .\narrest , said ken goodspeed , his partner , leaping dynamically from the passenger seat .\nken was a good-looking asian man in a stylish blazer , formerly of the federal bureau of investigation .\nhe was also just killed .\nthooop !\nsaid ken goodspeed .\nthe flaming arrow that had just lodged in his left eye socket continued to burn after his body hit the floor .\nnot my fault , said duke .\nthe worlds manliest action hero , duke manfist was as tall as he was wide .\nhis neck was thicker than his bullet-shaped head .\nhis dark hair was slicked into a battering ram .\nenormous biceps would have ripped his shirt sleeves to shreds , had his black muscle-t had sleeves .\nbecause , you know .\nit was sleeveless .\nhis bulging paunch stretched the fabric of his shirt taut and hung over the chrome manhole-cover-sized belt buckle at his waist , which held up his camouflage pants and bore the image of a grizzly bear riding a shark as both were carried in the talons of an eagle as they all fled a nuclear explosion .\nhe wore scuffed combat boots and carried an enormous revolver in a shoulder holster .\non his forehead were perched a pair of unlicensed ray-ban style sunglasses .\nhis jaw was so strong that it worked out on its own , while his chin could pull nails like a claw-hammer .\nan attractive woman in a nearby booth whose breasts were admirably large and whose waist was admirably thin was overcome by dukes manliness and fainted .\nher husband caught her , started to glare at duke , then thought better of it .\nthen he , too , fainted .\nduke drew his jackson arms revolver .\nthe plot-tuned action of the weapon stopped working whenever it was convenient or inconvenient but duke had a good feeling about his gun today .\nthat might have had something to do with the explosive bullets he had loaded that morning .\nblam !\nsaid dukes revolver .\nblam !\nblam !\nwhooosh , said a ninja .\nfooooom !\ni dont want to whoosh-foom , said another of the ninja , now paralyzed with fear and getting ready to also-faint .\ntodays not your day , nancy , said duke , and whoosh-foomed the ninja into flaming ninja-parts , all of which fainted individually .\nchaos erupted .\nthe surviving ninja ran for it , but duke fired after them , destroying large swaths of the gordos in the process .\nhe had just taken aim at the last of the remaining ninja when another ninja , already wreathed in flame , went running past his line of sight .\nbill ?\nsaid the first ninja .\nwhereve you been , man ?\naaaaaarrrrggggghhhhhhh !\nscreamed the ninja who was on fire .\nduke and his revolver blammed at them .\nthe ninja who was not bill made a beautiful fooming noise as his assets were reallocated across the dining area .\nthe already flaming ninja , however , disappeared through the exit before duke could shoot him .\nmanfist took aim and tried , but his weapon clicked conveniently ( or inconveniently ) empty .\nnext time , pal , he said , projecting from his diaphragm , well just see whos the flamer .\nhe turned to the man in the shower curtain expectantly .\nuh , said the fat man .\nno ?\nduke said .\nwhat about ... next time , pal ... that burning sensation youre feeling will be ... justice .\nthe fat man shook his neck fat .\nnuh uh .\nnext time , pal , duke tried again , youll be trailing the smoke of having recently been ... killed .\nhe whipped the sunglasses off his forehead as he said it , then put them back on .\nyeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh !\nscreamed the man in the shower curtain , in a perfect imitation of roger daltry from the who .\nwere we doing a whole csi : miami thing there ?\nduke asked .\nner , said the man in the shower curtain .\nerm herving a strerk .\nyoure having a stroke ?\nasked duke .\nthey got coupons for that here .\nermahgerd , said the fat man .\ner dernt wernt ter der .\nno , im not thirsty , gerard butler , said duke .\nand we ditched that whole meme thing after the halloween special .\nggttthhhhkkkkk , said the fat man .\nboy , you can say that again , said duke .\nhe climbed back into the humway , fired up the engine , and backed out of the restaurant , his front bumper trailing brick , mortar , and ninja grease .\nthe humway reversed neatly into the gas station across the street , deliberately cutting off a hybrid-electric prius .\nduke paused long enough to fire a few rounds from his revolver after the retreating prius , but did not manage to hit anything .\ni hate pumping my own gas , he said .\nto be continued ... part 2 : alvin tostig has a son today duke manfist grabbed the gray 1980s brick-phone mounted to the dash and dialed the operator , which was secret headquarters idea of a hidden code to reach secret headquarters .\nwhen the connection went through , a television screen on the dash illuminated with the image of doctor coplawyer , secret headquarters operations manager , law enforcement liaison , legal adviser , medical officer , accountant , accredited scuba instructor , ice sculptor , it manager , caterer , and iso auditor .\nhe was wearing his customary sam browne duty belt , bulletproof vest , three-piece suit , and white medical jacket .\na stethoscope and a badge hung around his neck .\ncoplawyer was the man responsible for recruiting , deceiving , and sometimes kidnapping the various personnel who became duke manfists ill-fated partners .\neach of the ken goodspeeds signed an ironclad service contract remanding them to coplawyers custody .\ntheir names were legally changed to ken goodspeed for the duration of the contract , which prevented duke from having to learn hundreds of new names every month a feat which duke , the sole field operative for secret headquarters and the product of an experimental program to create the worlds manliest action hero , was ill-equipped to manage .\nwhile he was impossibly fearless , impossibly strong , and impossibly manly , duke manfist was not terribly bright .\ni know a narrator whos gon na get punched if he doesnt stop calling me dumb , said duke .\nwhile he was impossibly fearless , impossibly strong , impossibly handsome , impossibly brave , and impossibly manly , he was not fond of things like math , science , words , or information , which made tasks of rote memorization , short-term memory , long-term memory , and other things best left to pencil-necks , nerds , and nancies things which he seldom bothered to trouble himself with .\nall that and you ended the sentence with a preposition ?\nasked coplawyer .\ndont you start .\ncan we continue with the first-chapter exposition ?\nwhatever chokes your mime , pal , said duke .\nhe glanced out the window as a flaming ninja ran past in the other direction , screaming and trailing smoke .\nduke , said coplawyer .\nthe shadow president would like an update .\nthe shadow president was the man who told the real president , the real congress , and the real ghostbusters what to really do .\nthat last bit is parody and no copyright infringement is implied or should be inferred .\nthe shadow president was the only man manly enough to give duke manfist orders , and had in fact contributed the genetic material used to create duke manfist ( and a host of less than successful almost-duke-manfists , who shared the unfortunate side effect of being serial killers and the more fortunate side effect of having been killed by duke manfist during the halloween special ) .", "Subject": "Simon", "label": "Delight", "source": "Bookcorpus_538.txt", "choices": ["Delight", "Anger", "Embarrassment",

''\nriesling huffed , but dracen shook his head .\n`` that should not be difficult .\nthe lady elaina does not have the airs of a caster , happily .\nbefore this , i might have said they acted like a couple courting . ''\nthe drethlord finished significantly .\nriesling noddednot a touchy commander , but a lover 's quarrel .\ndracen doesnt seem to see the irony in a drethlord talking about the airs of a caster .\n`` what are the dangers ?\nhow many will be needed to guard her ? ''\n`` she is in no danger from me , and i can think of a few others with certainty .\neverything and everyone else , though .\n.\n.\nhis warning trailed off .\nriesling sighed .\nthat leaves a lot of danger .\n`` how many , do you think ? ''\n`` no more than five , or she will object . ''\n`` five will not stop very much . ''\nriesling noted gruffly .\n`` you do n't need to stop it , general .\nyou need to slow it down and let her see it .\nthe lady elaina is powerful enough to handle anything if you manage that . ''\nthe general blinked .\nwell thats likely the highest compliment the sour old sore ever gave !\n`` anything ? ''\nhe repeated , doubtfully .\nhe had fought with the drethlords before and seen the limits to their impressive powers .\n`` anything . ''\ndracen confirmed .\nvery well , if that is what he says .\nyou said you know a few who are trustworthy ?\nseven or so ? ''\nriesling asked , calculating time on the road and time on watch .\ndracen frowned .\n`` yes .\ni 'll send them to you at once .\nuntil then , you watch her . ''\nthe order was a growl of annoyance as the drethlord stalked away .\nrylan ignored the low grumble of harlon and lorne arguing over by the horses .\nthe cousins were constantly at each other 's throats , even if they would defend each other to the death .\nstaring at the fire with half-lidded eyes , he drifted into a daydream of better times , when they had all been boys at landoram .\na grin twisted his lips for a moment .\nthey had been terrorstraipsing about the fort causing trouble as naturally as birds flew : sneaking sweetbread from the kitchens , playing soldier with any armor left unattended , setting loose an ornery badger on his older brother 's picnic with pretty roselyn , the old blacksmith slade 's daughter .\nhis eyes flew open .\nthere was a noise that he barely heard , like a horse blowing restlessly nearby .\nrylan dug the whetstone out of his belt pouch and reached over to his pile of things to draw a sword .\ncasually , he began to sharpen it in long strokes .\nwhisk .\nwhisk .\nwhisk .\na shadow moved on his right , but rylan did n't look up .\nlet the thing come , whatever it is .\nman or beast , he would deal with it in the light of the fire , not scare it off to lurk in the night .\n`` you wo n't need that . ''\ncame the shadow 's voice , silencing harlon and lorne .\nthey eased back to the fire , though hands did not yet stray to the hilts over their shoulders .\nnot yet .\na cloaked figure moved into the flickering light .\n`` i 'm cade .\ni saw the fire and recognized antral in your weapons .\ni may not carry the e'dan and a'lan anymore , but perhaps you have room at your fire for another son of antral . ''\nrylan examined him closely .\nhis name was antralian , as was the cut of his black coat .\ndark eyes regarded him frankly , but they were far from readable .\n`` rylan of landoram , '' he said at last .\n`` and these are harlon and lorne of the same . ''\nthey nodded as they were introduced .\nthe newcomer saluted them in the old way as he bowedone fist to his chest , the other to the small of his back .\nrylan frowned .\nonly officers ever use both hands , everyone else puts a fist over their heart .\nhe filed the thought away .\n`` where in the homeland do you hail from , cade ? ''\nharlon inquired .\n`` alcondar , though my family traveled widely . ''\nthe man answered easily , it was not a lie .\nrylan said nothing of the cold bitterness in his tone .\nclearly , he is not among those reconciled to the invasion .\nthat is just as well , neither are we .\n`` be welcomed at our fire then , cade of alcondar . ''\nlorne said with a quick grin .\nnodding , he tossed down the saddlebags he had tossed over one shoulder .\n`` i must see to my mount , '' he said shortly , then slipped back into the night as quietly as he had come .\nin the stillness , rylan and the cousins considered each other .\nthey did not speak , but rylan knew that none of them would be far from their weapons that night , antralian or no .\ncade returned with a towering stallion that was as dark a black as the night around it .\nrylan let his eyebrows rise as he studied the beast .\nthis isnt an everyday farm hack , or even the racer of a gentleman .\nthat beast is a charger , a warhorse , the horse of a battle lord .\nhis gaze flicked back to cade , who had saluted like an officer , lived in alcondar , and rode that creature .\nrylan 's eyes narrowed , considering .\nhe cant possibly be that cade .\nthats ridiculous !\n`` you said your family traveled , your father was a merchant , perhaps ? ''\nhe asked casually .\nno expression showed on the newcomer 's face as he agreed , `` he was involved with trade . ''\nrylan paused .\nthat was not an answer to the question .\n`` you 've a fine animal there , where did you get him ? ''\nharlon asked , seeing the drift of rylans thoughts .\n`` it was a gift from my commander . ''\ncade replied shortly .\nrylan nodded to himself .\nnot that cade , then , if he had a commanding officer .\nan uncrowned king of antral would acknowledge no commander .\nfive days later , rylan was not so sure .\nthe newest member of their outfit was born to lead men .\nhe said little , but what he said was as sound as anything harlon and lorne could have worked out between them in a week .\nthe day before , the four of them came across a band of marauders , horse thieves and blacker criminals by their talk .\nwhile the three antralians had never held themselves responsible for keeping order in amanheld , they made a habit of ridding their current residence of any such groups they came across on the march .\n`` let 's go ! ''\nharlon growled as they peered down at the camp from a hilltop .\nthe fire below illuminated an circle twenty paces across , and fourteen men lounged in its flickering light .\ntwice as many horses were picketed just beyond .\n`` no . ''\ncade disagreed calmly as raucous laughter floated up to them .\nall three turned to him , but he did not register their surprise .\nthe light comes halfway up the hill , here .\nthey 'll see us well before we get down .\nthose two there will take half our number before we reach the bottom , '' he said , pointing out the men with loaded crossbows leaning beside them .\n`` they may be country thieves , but they 're good enough to survive in this large a group for some amount of time .\ntwo against fourteen is not good odds , even if you make it past the arrows .\nwe 'll go around there , against the spur of the hill , and stay in shadow as long as possible .\ni 'll cut the horse lines , draw them into the dark .\nsome will stay , and you fall on those from there , '' cade instructed , nodding to the shadowed ridge at the base of the rise .\n`` we attack in silence .\nfear is half the battle .\nmake them fear the silence and the dark .\nif you 're going to be surrounded fall back into the night , understood ? ''\nwhen they only stared at him in considering silence , he pressed , `` do you disagree ? ''\nnone did .\n`` we 'll do as you say , captain . ''\nlorne said with a feral grin .\ncade did n't return the smile , just nodded .\nrylan watched him as he led the way off the hill , slinking in the shadows .\nwhat sort of man comes up with a plan of attack in a matter of seconds that involves him facing the brunt of the enemy 's anger alone in the dark ?\nnever mind that he delivers his orders like a general when he is the newest to the group .\neither this cade of alcondar is hoping to die , or he is very , very good .\nor both .\nit was simple for them to get into position , with the bandits drinking and shouting .\nthere were few people to hear you in emons march .\ncade slipped off along the edge of the shadow as dark as the night around him , disappearing behind the line of horses .\nslowly at first , the horses began to stomp and snort , blowing restlessly at the unfamiliar shadow in their midst .\nin no time cade had them rearing and bucking against their ropes .\nrylan watched the thieves divert their attention to the animals .\n`` go quiet 'em down , brice . ''\none suggested .\na chorus of others joined in until brice hauled himself to his feet and trudged toward the unruly horses .\njust then , one of the animals gave a scream of fear and the line snapped .\nthey took off into the darkness in a thundering mess of hooves .\n`` damn ya to the evermind , brice !\nwe 'll never catch the beasts now ! ''\nsomeone groused from the fire .\na few men stood and marched over to him .\n`` what set the dumb animals off , anyway ? ''\none man asked .\nbryce 's dying cry was his only answer .\nit set the group to immediate action , jerking them upright like puppets on a string .\nhefting their weapons , half charged into the dark , while the others eyed the night restlessly .\nrylan could almost see cade dancing on the edge of the light , leaving death behind him .\nthe bandits could n't tell quite where he was , and those that happened across him did n't take another breath .\n`` let 's move , before he does it all himself ! ''\nharlon hissed in his ear , slinking from the shadows .\nonly two of the horse thieves saw them approach , but the light in their eyes to finally recognize an enemy did not last long .\nby the time they cut their way to cade , there were none left alive .\nthe antralians counted the bodies and discovered two had fled into the vastness of the march .\nrylan kept his own count : cade had killed seven of the twelve .\nhe hesitated to say anything , but rylan could n't help but ask , `` who was your teacher , cade of alcondar ?\ni 've seen few men to equal you with a sword . ''\ndark eyes held his , and he stood from wiping his blade on a dead mans coat .\n`` need is a harsh teacher , rylan of landoram , and there has always been great need . ''\nharlon and lorne left off dragging the bodies to the fire to join them .\n`` it is said that king alcedar was a great swordsman and taught his sons at a young age .\nthey would have had great need , i am sure . ''\nharlon said meaningfully .\nrylan was not surprised , even if they had not discussed their suspicions .\nweve all been wondering about him , and there are a hundred clues that he is more than he says .\ncade did not respond .\n`` are you cade a'lan gidedrian of alcondar , captain ? ''\nlorne asked .\nfor a moment , rylan did n't think he would answer .\n`` i am . ''\nhe pulled a chain around his neck from under his shirt to show them a heavy silver ring with a great curling wave on it .\nas if we would not believe .\nhe has the horse , he fights like a battlelord , salutes like an officer , and commands like a king .\nand , truth , but he looks like archaron .\nharlon sucked his breath between his teeth , and a grin grew on lorne 's face .\nrylan stared .\nsuspicions did not prepare a man for the truth .\nhow did he survive and escape the drethlords ?\nwhat of corin e'dan and sarina alcora ?\nwhat is he doing in emon 's march ?\nhe wanted answers , but he did n't need them .\nif this man was gidedrian , then the royal line of antral was free and unbroken .\nhe was the prince , and if they could rebuild antral , he would be the king .\nantral will be as it was before , he will restore it .\nthe family gidedrian will rule from alcondar , and our people will have a home .\nwe will have a home .\nrylan knelt in the dirt and drew his right-handed sword .\ngrasping the blade in his hands , he offered the hilt to prince gidedrian .\nthe razor edge cut into his palms and his fingers sending streams of dark red down the steel to drip off the point .\n`` on my blood , i am your man from now to evermore .\nmy sword is my pledge . ''\nhe swore in the old way , as men had sworn to the kings of antral since the first warriors swore to aldebaron .\nthey spoke in the common languagea man 's oath ought to be above question in any tongue .\nif gidedrian took the sword , the oath was accepted .\nrylan could feel the prince 's eyes on him .\n`` i am sworn to protect another , i can not be king . ''\nhe said at last .\nrylan did n't move .\nhe did n't care .\nbeside him , harlon and lorne knelt and drew their swords .\nthey made their pledge in unison .\nthe three of them had wandered the wilderness of arith for years .\neven if antral could never rise again , even if prince gidedrian would never be king , they would follow .\nthey would ride where he rode and fight where he fought .\nif there is to be no home , what honor is left but to defend the royal line ?\nthey waited for him to take their swords , their oaths .\nhe took rylan 's first , then harlon 's , then lorne 's , simply holding each until they closed their fingers on the cross guards .\nthen he strode off into the night , leaving them to scramble to their feet and follow after .\ntruth , but he doesnt say much !\nrylan got the feeling that not many of his questions were going to be answered .\ngeneral riesling was marching between the lines of cookfires heading for his blankets when a voice from the nearest fire stopped him .\n`` general !\ncould i have a word ? ''\nit was trevanor ibelin , the young captain from jernal , and he was already rising to meet him in the semi-shadow .\n`` what is it , trevanor ? ''\n`` i 've been keeping a close eye on lady elaina , sir , '' `` good , that 's your job . ''\n`` yes , sir .\nbut , i 'm worried , general .

''\nriesling lowered his voice , glancing around them , but trevanor was shaking his head .\n`` not about that , sir , about her . ''\nhe shook his head , anxious frown wrinkling his forehead , `` she does n't eat , and i can hear her at night when i 'm on watchshe is n't sleeping .\nshe used to be the last one awake every morning , now she 's the first .\ni think she 's having nightmares .\n.\n. ''\nhe paused uncomfortably .\nriesling did n't speak .\nno doubt shes been given plenty of cause for nightmares .\n`` i do n't know what happened , but you did n't see her before , sir , when he was here .\nshe used to be so .\n.\n.\nalive .\nshe smiled and laughed all the time .\n.\n.\nif not for the eyes and the power , she was as cheerful as a farm girl , sir .\nand now '' the young man shook his head again .\nriesling studied the soldier .\nwhen he was here , eh ?\nthat will be this cade person again .\nnow , is this the concern of a guard or a brother figure ?\nah , but at least he cares .\nhell protect her better that way .\n`` calm yourself , ibelin . ''\nhe said without his usual bark .\n`` she is n't a farm girl , and she had to stop acting like one eventually .\ni 'll keep an eye on her , but id bet a month 's pay she will soon recover her appetite and other habits .\nlook to your duties , man .\nit will work out . ''\nchapter 35 the assassin two weeks later , general riesling was glad captain ibelin hadnt taken his bet .\nthe lady elaina looked like a wraith , one of the spirits that slip into the evermind and back into this world .\nher face had lost its softness and the pale cast of her skin was broken only by the dark circles under her eyes .\nnew recruits had taken to calling her the ice queen , since she never smiled or frowned .\nsome claimed they had never seen her blink .\nshe was going through the motions , but riesling had to agree with the younger menthe lady elaina hardly seems to be alive .\nat that moment , riesling was walking behind her and dracen and a clerk .\nwhere in arith do all these people come from ?\nhe wondered , not for the first time .\nwho have i to blame for the fact half the new men have no weapons ?\ndracen growled at the wispy little man .\nthe cooks , my lord .\nthe clerk answered without hesitation .\nstone-stupid .\nreisling thought to himself and tuned out the berating dracen unleashed on the unsuspecting fellow .\ninstead , riesling wondered again what had happened between the guardian and cade .\nno one ever spoke his name around her , but he was practically a legend among the men .\nthe older members were forever telling the new recruits how things were `` before , when cade was here . ''\nif he ever returns , the man will have a difficult time living up to his reputation .\napparently he was as handsome as a spirit and a better swordsman than malakail hontari and piter leoncora combined .\nthere were even whispers that he was a prince and lord of battles , of all things .\nshaking his head at the foolishness of camp rumors , riesling focused his attention on the lady elaina , dracen , and the clerk .\nAfter weeks of hard work and determination, Andy was finally able to open his art exhibition and display his portraits. While he invited all of the people at work, none of them showed up. As he was packing up to leave, his boss showed up, pointed to his painting, and praised his skills.\ndracen was now audibly grinding his teeth while the clerk babbled an explanation .\nas usual , the lady elaina was unresponsive , as if she were walking alone in an empty field rather than beside the two of them through an encampment .\nits just not right .\nand why wont this fool shut up ?\ncant he see hes infuriating them ?\nwell , hes infuriating dracen anyway .\ni doubt the guardian has even noticed him .\n`` .\n.\n.then the cooks refused to give the blacksmiths enough salt to quench anything properlyso they have only a fresh water barrel for softer steel , but no salt one .\nso you see , the cooks are the reason we have n't enough of the blades and points , not the blacksmiths . ''\nthe clerk rattled on , `` really , you must give themthe cooksa direct order to give themthe blacksmithsthe salt , but then there will not be enough for the soup , so if there is a place nearby where we could get more '' `` enough ! ''\ndracen interrupted flatly .\nriesling squashed the smile that twitched on his lips when the clerk nearly jumped out of his skin .\n`` you were put in charge of these things so that we would n't have to hear you prate about them .\nfix it .\nsalt half as many barrels as the blacksmiths needthey can share .\nleave the rest with the cooks .\nif they whine , tell them they can come try their luck whining at me . ''\nthe clerk paled , and licked his lips nervously , but did n't leave .\nstupid , sure , but brave .\nhed make a good banner man .\n`` of course my lord , my lady , '' he bobbed a bow at both of them , `` that would give us what we need in a few days .\n.\n. ''\ndracen scowled at the little ferret .\n`` ah , but if you could come with me now , my lord , the then it would go much faster , i am certain . ''\nelaina turned to look at him , and he quavered under two grey-eyed stares .\nstill , he held his ground .\nriesling was mildly impressed .\n`` would n't even have to say anything .\n.\n. ''\nthe clerk finished weakly .\nthe little man 's first nervous glance up from the dirt was for elaina , but her expression was blank , so he shifted his focus to dracen .\nriesling frowned .\neveryone is doing that .\nthe lady elaina is just not here .\nthe brother 's lip twitched with displeasure , but he halted .\nelaina walked on steadily .\nriesling hesitated between them , uncertain who he ought to follow .\nstone-faced and obviously displeased , dracen went with the clerk , who smiled anxiously and bowed and babbled his thanks and assurances of success .\nleaving the drethlord to sort out the underlings by himself , riesling followed elaina .\nthey had n't made it more than twenty spans before he felt himself slow .\nhe tried to walk , but it was like moving through molasses instead of air .\nsomething was holding him back .\nnot airair .\noutside the web , he could see dracen ordering soldiers , who fell in around them .\nit took him forever to turn his head to elaina , who was falling at fraction of the normal speed , holding her throat .\nriesling felt it too , the screaming in his lungs for air .\nhe ignored it and froze , watching dracen through the air .\nhe would just have to stay on his feet and wait .\nscowling , dracen looked back at the center of the net .\nthe wide-eyed clerk was chattering shrilly , but brother dracen ignored him , concentrating on the snare that captured lady elaina and general riesling .\nthe net had thickened the natural air , slowing everything in its range to dream-like motion , easy targets .\nhe shouted for the soldiers to form a ring around the edgesthey could feel it , even if only he could see .\nno enemy will get in bow range .\nnothing moved among the tree trunks .\nwhat is the purpose ?\nwith narrowed eyes , he turned and watched the wielder 's hand move to her throat , expression of vague surprise on her face as she fell .\nhe understood .\nshe could n't breathe .\nthis is not an attack , it is an assassination .\nquickly , he spun his own net over the assassin 's .\ncountering nets had never been his strong point , but if he could locate the weaver .\n.\n.\n`` archers , '' he roared , `` to me !\nwe seek a grey-eyed assassin .\nquickly ! ''\nsoldiers ran to him , joining the ranks of those gathered on the outside edges .\nsome of the green troops watched elaina stumble and fall to her knees , her skirts and hair trailing out behind her like she was underwater .\nhe could feel her lashing out with air and fire , but the net shifted under her attack , never letting up .\nthe assassin is nearby then , holding it in place .\nthe veterans eyed the trees darkly .\nbetween them moved black-coated watchers , peering into the eyes of any man looking at elaina .\nthey will see the eyes .\nillusions will not work on the ashendari .\ndracen 's eyes flickered among the troops .\nif the weaver were among them , they would discover him .\nif he was not , the weaver would have to be able to see her .\n.\n.\ndracen jerked his gaze up into the treetops , scanning between the leaves and branches , searching .\ngeneral riesling felt his muscles weaken and blinked through the black specks and bright flashes that winked and spun across his vision .\nit was oddly quietsounds were too low and garbled , not matching the movements outside this thing they were caught in .\nelaina was laying in the dirt where she fell , still clutching her throat .\nshe was n't strong enough to stay conscious much longer , he could see it even with the ever-present emptiness of her eyes .\nfor an instant , emotion twisted her face .\nriesling watched , fascinated , as pain and longing and heartbreak wrote themselves on her features , alive in silver eyes as they slowly dulled .\nhis air-deprived mind was slow to recognize the expressions , but even so he knew what was happening .\nshe is saying goodbye to someone .\njust as the realization jerked through his sluggish mind riesling sank to his knees , unable to stand any longer .\nby the time he looked over at lady elaina again she was unconscious .\nif dracen doesnt find the assassin soon , neither of us are going to survive .\ndracen saw the flicker of movement out of the of his eye .\na leaf shifting in wind , a bird , or a foot dangled off a branch , its charcoal grey boot quickly pulled back behind a wall of leaves .\nsilently , dracen yanked a passing archer so hard the lad almost fell .\nhe was young , one of the recruits , but he carried the long bow of a country archer like he knew how to use it .\nunwilling to allow the weaver to shield himself , dracen made no noise , pointing the way for the archer .\nsquinting into the trees , the archer raised the bow to his shoulder with careful aim .\naround them , other archers saw and followed his gaze into the trees , bows creaking as they were drawn .\ndracen raised his hand while he waited until enough of them had joined their hunt .\nthe assassin would not escape .\nhe brought his hand down harshly , and the arrows sprang off the bowstrings with a tell-tale snap .\nit was too late for the caster .\nmany of the arrows knifed through the leaves harmlessly , but enough did not .\nthe solid sound of metal hitting flesh was followed by the crashing of a body down through the branches .\nthe soldiers who had not noticed the little group of archers wheeled around at the noise .\nthose stuck in the net finished falling at normal speed , gasping and panting for breath .\nelaina stirred in the dirt , and riesling recovered himself enough to help her rise .\na crowd soon gathered in the trees around the misshapen form , but they made way for dracen when he stalked through .\nthe brother unceremoniously kicked the corpse onto its back .\nbrother segarin .\nsightless eyes darkened to a muddy brown as the changing reversed in death .\nsegarin was no longer deeply connected to his power .\nhe is no longer connected to life at all .\ndracen spared no sympathy for the man he had once sworn to as a brother .\n`` leave him where he lies . ''\n`` we will not burn him , my lord ? ''\nsomeone asked in surprise .\nto not burn the body was to leave it bound to earth in asemaline tradition , to prevent it from joining the blessed dead in the heavens .\neven mortal enemies would burn each other 's bodies in victory .\napparently someone knew enough of asemal to know that .\ndracen looked at the faces around him impassively .\n`` no peace for assassins . ''\nhe ordered , turning away to rejoin the wielder and the general .\nslowly , the soldiers followed .\nrylan swore as cade jerked his black into a sharp turn right in front of him , forcing his own horse to rear back to avoid a collision .\n`` gidedrian ! ''\nhe objected , clinging to the saddle .\nthere was no response .\nthe prince was staring to the southwest the way a man looks at water in a desert .\nrylan frowned and followed his gaze .\nthere was nothing but the low sloping hills of emon 's march , unbroken by shrubs or treesthe same scenery that filled the horizon on every side and had for days .\nrylan turned his frown to gidedrian .\nup ahead , harlon and lorne finally noticed and were turning back to join them .\n`` what is it ?\nwhat do you see ? ''\nrylan questioned , from the empty grassland to the intensely focused face of the prince .\nhe looks like a man seeing a spirit .\n`` what 's happened to her ? ''\nhe muttered .\nrylan surveyed the landscape doubtfully once again .\nher ?\nthere is no one there .\nbefore he could ask , gidedrian spoke again , eyes never leaving the spot in the southwest .\n`` i 'm called .\ni must go .\nride with me or not , as you choose . ''\nrylan stared after him as he heeled his stallion into a gallop , racing toward the horizon in an unwavering line .\nharlon rode up just as rylan reined his mount in , which pranced impatiently to follow the lead of the black warhorse .\n`` what is he doing ? ''\nhe asked .\nlorne joined them in time to hear the answer , frowning after the fast-retreating form of their leader .\n`` leaving .\nhe said he was called , and that we could join him or not . ''\nrylan relayed .\n`` has he lost his mind ? ''\nlorne asked with incredulous concern .\n`` no .\n.\n. ''\nharlon squinted after him .\n`` but there are only two things i know of that can make a man ride like that : a brother or a woman . ''\n`` he asked himself what was happening to 'her ' '' rylan offered .\n`` so he 's after a lover , then . ''\nlorne guessed , sounding only slightly less morose at that than the prospect of insanity .\n`` do we follow ? ''\nrylan impatiently interrupted .\nharlon shrugged .\n`` if he rides like that , he and the horse wo n't survive to see whoever he 's after . ''\nlorne noted .\nthe others nodded .\n`` then hurry , he has the lead .\nriding that monster , we 'll have a time catching him , not to mention getting him to slow . ''\nrylan ordered , digging his heels into his mount 's ribs as he gave the horse its head .\nlaying its ears back , the animal took off after the stallion .\nit took hours to truly catch him , even though their geldings were quicker and lighter than his charger .\nhe was riding as if his life depended on it .\n`` gidedrian , '' lorne called as they neared .\ntheir leader did not turn his head , scowling at the horizon .\nrylan studied him with concern .\nthe man is desperate .\n`` you 're killing your horse , my lord . ''\nharlon yelled .\nurging his bay closer , rylan tried another approach , `` how long will it take to reach her on foot , gidedrian , because that is where you 're headed . ''\nfor an instant , dark eyes flicked to him in acknowledgement .\nrylan would have bet a full purse he did n't have that it was the first time the prince had looked away from the horizon since this began .\ntruth , but he is single-minded .\nhe slowed marginally .\n`` dismount and run , if you want to keep time and save the animal . ''\nlorne suggested .\nthe prince pursed his lips in annoyance for a moment , then slowed enough to slide from the saddle and hit the ground running .\nrelieved , the other antralians followed suit .\nrylan wondered how many days they were going to run like this and was glad for all the time spent living hard .\nwithout it , there is no way i could keep up .\ngidedrian is the finest fighter ive seen and more than a little unbalanced .\ni only hope we are all alive enough at the end of this to face whatever danger he thinks this woman is in .\nif there were only two things that made men do something like this , then the three of them were running for a brother and one for a girl .\nmore than just following the prince into danger , rylan wanted to meet the source of this trouble .\nany woman who stole the heart of cade a'lan gidedrian so completely has to be more than a little extraordinary .\nthey rode and ran for five days , stopping for an hour four of five times a day to rest the horses before they raced south and west once more .\nrylan could barely contain his dread when they emerged from a clump of trees to the edge of a small camp , neatly laid out on a grid .\nnot rabble , an army .\nsoldiers were everywhere .\ni can barely stand and the horses are almost finished .\nif we have to fight their way out of this place .\n.\n.\ngidedrian obviously did n't share his hesitation .\nhe rode right up to the sentries that dug into the loamy soil , piling it up on the inside edge to create a temporary wall and ditch .\nrylan tensed , reaching to his shoulder for the hilt of his sword as they approached the guard .\nto his shock , the man in the helmet directing the work only nodded to them with surprise , though most of the workers watched uncertainly .\nhe and harlon exchanged a significant glance .\napparently , these soldiers know the prince .\nthat doesnt mean this isnt a trap .\nhe could feel his hair stand on end as a woman hurrying by stopped to stare at them .\nher surprised eyes were absolutely colorless .\na grey-eyed caster .\nshe took a step forward , and rylan jerked his sword free with grim promise .\nharlon and lorne followed his lead , but gidedrian did n't react .\nthe caster stepped back from their path , though her cool glance followed them .\nrylan did n't have the chance to keep a wary eye on herthe prince began running , turning sharply around tents and horse lines as if he were directed through the maze by an internal compass .\nignoring the howls of protest from his muscles , rylan matched his pace .\nim not about to lose sight of him now , not after all of this .\ngidedrian stopped dead in his tracks .\nrylan peered around him and knew they were done running .\nthank the true spirits !\nan officer , a general probably , walked in the center of the avenue between tents in a shining breastplate that showed the marks of long use .\nhe held the corner of a piece of paper absently , watching the four of them approach .\nhe didnt look worried precisely , just curious .\nat his side , holding the other side of the paper , walked a woman .\nshe had n't noticed them yet , studying the scroll before her .\nlong hair fell halfway to her waist in loose waves .\nher back was straight , her waist narrow , and she was no taller than the general 's shoulder .\nshe was handsome in a common way , pretty without being gorgeous .\nthe prince 's eyes practically blazed when he looked at her .\nthis is the girl .\nthen he was moving again , and they followed three paces behind .\nthe general stopped , and at last she followed his gaze to the four of them .\nrylan almost shouted .\nthe woman stared back at them with slate-grey eyes .\nchapter 36 the light elaina frowned at the map as they walked .\nriesling was trying to teach her basic tactics , but she wasnt sure the same rules applied when casters were involved .\nhe had pointed out a bowl at the foot of the mountains north of vinyam as a good place to fall back should the drethlords suddenly appear .\nif they attack us here , they are surrounded by an army on higher ground .\nhe explained , and we have the advantage of difficult terrain at our backs , so we can retreat into the woods and regroup elsewhere .\nelaina eyed him , if they attack us in the bowl , they can see the whole field and pick off the casters .\nand difficult terrain at our backs might just as well turn into a hindrance to usit isnt as if all our soldiers are from this area , she pointed out , theyll be just as lost in the wilds as the drethlords .\nplus , they are the wilds , riesling admitted .\nthough that is likely more intimidating to the drethlords than othersthere are echoes of power in that place that they can not match and they know it .\ngeneral riesling didnt reply , just stopped where he stood .\nelaina assumed he was just looking for her next lesson on the map , but when he stayed silent , she gave a little tug on the map and started up again .\nriesling let her pull it from his hands .\nshe turned to frown at him , but he was staring past her , over her shoulder .\nelaina suddenly noticed the camp was unusually quiet .\nalarmed , she spun around .\nit wasnt an attack or an assassin .\ncade .\nthere .\nright in front of her .\nshe let the map fall to the dirt .\nvaguely she felt the cautious eyes of everyone nearby .\nthere were more people than there ought to have been , far more than usual .\nlike they had followed cade there .\nthree men in rough clothes followed him still .\nthey moved with the easy grace that cade did , but their uncertainty was clear .\nmaybe they thought she would go crazy , obliterate everything in sight .\nthey could be right .\nher heart was busy making up for stopping when she saw him now , racing as if it wanted to fly out of her chest .\nshe did n't try to move toward him , afraid her knees would give way .\nelaina sank into her power .\nit would n't stop him , but it made it easier to think , to breathe .\nhe was walking closer .\ndeliberate , graceful .\nblast him !\nher thoughts broke and scattered like birds .\nhe was right in front of her .\nelaina could hardly believe she was still on her feet .\nit did n't please her , though .\nthe only pleasure was seeing him .\nand the only pain .\n`` elaina . ''\nhe whispered .\nholding the her power , she could hear him clearly .\nit was a call , a command , a plea .\na thousand thoughts swirled through her mind , a thousand things to say , all dismissed .\nthe men with him stopped , tense as coiled springs .\nthey were nothing .\ngeneral riesling was nothing .\nshe watched only cade , and she knew she had never stopped loving this man and could never stop .\neverything she tried to accomplish in the last three months was swept away .\nevery tenuous bridge she 'd built across that gaping hole in her chest collapsed like cobwebs .\njust the sight of him froze her mind and set her heart on fire .\nhow frustratingly weak , and after i tried so hard to be strong !\n`` elaina . ''\nhe was closer .\nnow she could hear he was out of breath , as if he had been running a moment ago .\nrunning to me !\nwhat a beautiful make-believe .\n`` what happened ? ''\nhe asked , standing a half-step closer than people did .\ndistracting .\nshe blinked at him .\n`` seven days ago , there was something .\n.\n. ''\nhe pressed , leaning in still closer , eyes shifting back and forth between hers as if to catch something in one that he might miss in the other .\n`` what happened ? ''\n`` i died . ''\nshe whispered , realizing that she did n't make any sense , but unable to think of any other words .\nhis brow furrowed .\nbeautiful , beautiful man .\nit really isnt fair at all .\n`` you died ? ''\nhis confusion slowly faded into what looked remarkably like joy .\nthat was peculiar , she knew , and forced herself to frown like she was supposed to .\nit was just so hard to think with him right there .\nshe wanted to reach out and she jerked her hand back to her side , hoping he had not noticed .\nis he happy i died ?\nsurely he can tell it did n't take .\n`` you thought of me . ''\nhe declared .\nelaina wanted to shake her head , to deny it .\nit was awful to think he would know .\nwhat if he laughs again ?\nlike he did in the garden , in the bad dreams ?\nit would n't be fair to him either , taking advantage of his nobility and making him stay with her out of guilt or duty .\nno i didnt think of you , i never think of you .\n.\n.\nshe felt herself nod .\ntruth damn it , i meant to lie !\ncade beamed .\nher heart was melting , just looking at him .\nhe is still so perfect .\n`` you love me ! ''\nhe cried , demanding her agreement , moving so their faces were almost touching .\nelaina had only felt this incoherent once before , the time she had been mindlessly drunk in tar haviel before everything began .\nbut this was insulting .\nhe 's come all this way to gloat ?\nshe scowled .\n`` why should that be any different ? ''\nshe said acidly , pulling back , `` has n't my love always been your problem ? ''\nhe paused , bewilderment sweeping across his face .\n`` problem ? ''\nhe repeated .\n`` yes ! ''\nshe drove a finger into his chest , `` i 'm not the one who left !\nwho fled !\ni 'm not the one who went away ! ''\nshe raged , tears just under the surface .\n`` but , i .\n.\n.\nyou sent me away ! ''\nhe was startled , off-balance .\noh truth !\n`` because you hated being near me !\nhated being trapped with me by an oath you never wished to swear !\ni freed you , and you bolted . ''\n`` hate ? ''\nhe repeated , stuck on the first accusations , `` how could i hate you ?\ni 'm the monster ! ''\n`` i know ! ''\nshe spat , `` i know !\nyou could n't even have just left , you had to '' she shuddered , `` her ! ''\nwas all she could manage .\n`` i 'm sorry . ''\nhe whispered , dejected , `` i had to , i thought she would come after you .\ni was only trying to protect you . ''\nhe stared at his hands as if they had betrayed him .\n`` protect me ? ''\nshe whispered , trembling .\n`` do you know what you did that day ? ''\nhe squeezed his eyes shut and turned his head as if he could hide from her words .\n`` you hurt me more than she could ever have dreamed .\nmore than keravel .\nmore than anything . ''\nher power pounded in her ears .\nshe imagined it was saara , that she could see it around each person like hetarth had shown her that first day .\nthe other people were distant torches compared to the bonfire that was the man in front of her .\nit was unspeakably wonderful to watch .\ntrue spirits , i even love his soul .\nhow did this happen ?\neven with miranya , with what he said that day ?\n`` i 'm so sorry . ''\nhe whispered , ducking his head .\n`` sorry , '' she repeated flatly , tears rolling down her face , `` you did n't look sorry .\ni 've never seen you look so alive as when you kissed her .\nnever heard you laugh like you did when she asked if you loved me .\nsorry ! ''\nhis frown deepened while he stared at his feet .\nelaina waited .\nhe did n't move .\nfine .\nshe turned on her heel and walked away as steadily as she could .\ni will walk away from my heart .\nleft it there in the dirt at his feet where it had always been .\nso he knows , so everyone knows .\nthat doesnt change anything .\nwhat is another mountain of humiliation when youre already buried in it ?\nwhat does any of it matter ?\n`` elaina , wait !\nlook at me ! ''\nshe felt her lips curl into a joyless smile .\nthat was exactly what he had said to her after the garden .\nshe stopped , but did not turn .\na small rebellion , the greatest resistance i can manage .\nhis hands were on her shoulders , spinning her around .\nher power flared brightly , a warning .\nhe was close to cutting her off .\ntruth , to feel his touch on my skin !\n`` why do you think i left ? ''\nhe asked insistently , half-shaking her shoulders .\n`` to find someone better to love . ''\nher anguished eyes roved the crowd around them , all standing at a safe distance , careful to avoid his face .\nthe little shreds of her that remained could n't handle looking at his face .\ndont look .\ndont you dare look .\n`` you 're a fool . ''\nhe said confidently , grip tightening on her arms .\n`` i know . ''\nshe sighed , waiting for the nightmare laugh .\ntruth , i know it .\n`` i love you . ''\ndespite herself , elaina looked into those dark , endless eyes .\nit was intoxicating .\nshe blinked .\nthe ramblings in her head were stunned into silence .\n`` what ? ''\n`` i love you . ''\nhe repeated quietly , pulling her closer until their foreheads touched .\nher power vanished , the pillars jerked out of reach .\nshe would have staggered if he had not been holding her so tightly .\nwhat is he saying ?\nhe went on , `` i thought you did n't want me , because i killed her , thought you never wanted to see me again .\nthat 's why i left .\nnot because i wanted to leave you .\ni never want to leave you , elaina . ''\nhe said fiercely .\n`` never . ''\n`` b-but in the garden ?\nyou were so happy with her . ''\nshe stammered .\n`` in the garden i was in chains , trying to save your life with an outrageous lie . ''\nhe smiled crookedly , `` i was so scared i was going to lose you to that madwoman .\n.\n. ''\nhis breath shuddered from between his lip .\nshe loved those lips .\nnot fair. ``\nyou 're right , i never was more alive with fear .\nand i do n't ever laugh like that , because i seldom come that close to losing my mind . ''\n`` losing your mind ? ''\n`` i could not survive if i lost you forever . ''\n`` because you love me ? ''\nshe repeated , incredulous .\n`` yes .\nyou 're my world . ''\nhe said it simply , as if he were saying that the sun rises in the morning .\nelaina shook her head .\nwhat ?\nno .\nthat can not be .\n`` but you left .\nyou did n't want me anymore .\ni made you kill your friend , a woman ! ''\nshe objected .\n`` what oath could i swear to make you believe me ?\ni love you , elaina , more than you can imagine .\nand you did n't make me do anything .\nthe only order you issued that day was for me to leaveeverything else i did on my own and i will atone for , not you , '' he assured her , `` besides , she was hardly friendly . ''\nelaina let him pull her into his chest in a crushing hug .\nwithout letting her go , he murmured into her hair , `` i love you .\nlet me show you .\ncast the web , the one from the ship , the one you cast again seven days ago . ''\n`` it 's an invasion of your mind ! ''\nshe protested weakly .\n`` i 'm telling you to , it 's not invading if youre invited . ''\nhe answered , and put his hands to his sides , waiting .\ncringing at the inevitable disappointment , elaina hesitated .\nit had been perfect , having him hold her .\nit was a dream that he was close enough to touch .\nand his words belonged to a dream .\nbut perfect things never last , and the best dreams always end .\nshe wanted it to last a little longer .\nwith a sigh , she cast : the perfect balance , the core harmony of pillars that echoed the linking and touched the forgotten and untouchable .\nthe separation between his mind and hers resonated .\nit cracked .\nthen it crumbled to dust .\nthis close , it was impossible to limit the sweep of his spirit through hers .\nshe could n't breathe .\nblinding light replaced the darkness , bright , clean , blazing light .\nthe noonday sun magnified and multiplied .\nglittering , shimmering , astonishing light .\n`` you love me . ''\nshe gasped .\n`` you idiot . ''\nhe murmured with a laugh , crushing her against him with one strong arm .\nthe other hand tangled in her hair , he breathed her in like a drowning man .\nher power was gone , but it had done enough .\nshe did n't know if she was breathing anymore .\nwhat does it matter ?\nbreathing is insignificant .\nhes here .\nhe loves me .\nelaina laughed so hard she cried .\nfinally , cade loosened his hold enough to look down at her and shook his head .\nlocked in his arms , she could feel the rumble in his chest when he spoke .\n`` what will i do with you ?\ni leave you alone for a fortnight or two and you almost get yourself killed . ''\nhe murmured .\n`` though i guess that should n't surprise me .\nyou draw trouble like honey draws flies . ''\nhis vexation was audible .\nhow right he was .\nit had not even been a year since she 'd left tar haviel , and how many times had she nearly died ?\nit hardly seemed that bad , standing there with him .\neven the memory of miranya 's warning could n't ruin this .\nelaina smiled more broadly .\n`` well , it is a lucky thing i have the greatest watcher in the world to keep me alive , is n't it ? ''\ncade snorted , `` i 'm the only real watcher . ''\nhe noted dryly .\n`` you 'll just have to stay close , then . ''\nshe suggested , `` make sure i stay out of trouble . ''\nanyone would have understood the slow smile that grew on cade 's face .\n`` oh , i intend to . ''\nhe growled , taking her by the waist and lifting her into the air , spinning her around as he had that last day in ashira .\nelaina threw her head back and laughed .\nwhen he set her down again , she was too dizzy to see dracen 's dour face , or the astonished expressions of the men who rode in with cade , or general rieslings sly smile , but she was n't deaf .\nthe whistles and cheers from everyone else made her blush , but she could n't stop smiling .\nand so long as hes here , i never will .\nthe end a note from the author thank you for taking the time to read the well of fates , the first book of the arithine chronicles .\nto contact me or get more information regarding forthcoming publications , please visit https : //www.smashwords.com/profile/view/abangen .\nread on for a short sneak peek at the next book in this series : in winter 's keeping .\nin winter 's keeping a .\nb. angen the snow lies soft and still the dark around it creeping the shadows breathe and walk while man and child are sleeping all they touch they take and all the world is weeping now death will always find those left to winters keeping .\nprologue winter , 3434 of the second aeon auhild slunk between the straight white trunks of the alders that lined the river .\nthe water was long since frozen solid , but he didnt want to walk on it tonight .\nthe wolves didnt like to go out on the ice .\nwinter winds blew the snow off of the frozen surface and left little traction for them .\nan owl hooted once , and auhild paused , listening .\nthere was no answer .\nhe froze , searching the shadows , holding his breath so the clouds of vapor didnt interrupt his view .\nsince valdr had discovered the truth behind the mysterious deaths , theyd all been on their guard .\nit didnt save many , but at least people knew what to fear .\nit was hard to run from everything .\nis it any easier to wage a war on shadows ?\nthe woods were dangerous tonight , tonight and every night .\nbut night was dangerous everywhere .\nhe wanted to be home with freya and little kell .\nfreya would have the fire built up , and all the candles lit .\nthe whole house would be glowing with light .\nhe eyed the darkness .\nthe howl of a wolf rose slowly over the valley .\none by one other voices joined the first until the whole pack was crying at the night .\nauhild gasped .\nso many , and close .\nhe scanned the bare treetops for the bright eyes of the owl that had called before , but saw nothing .\nthey were all close , but not close enough .\njust to his right , a shadow shifted .\nauhild didnt wait to see more .\nhe sprinted for the house , only a half a league away , but he knew hed never make it .\nhe wondered if freya and kell would hear him scream , but there wasnt time .\nthe footsteps crunched through the snow right behind him , only two steps .\nthen he felt a whisper of a breeze on the back of his neck .\nhis body crumpled lifeless into the snow .\nchapter 1 the warning elaina opened one eye , looking for the source of the shuffling noise that interrupted the stillness .\nfor a moment she lay tense in her cot , wondering what sort of creature had intruded into her tent .\nraccoon , maybe .\nor rabbit ?\nplease , not a rat .\nsuddenly , she remembered who would be in her tent in the wee hours of the morning : cade had come back .\nthe thought made her lips turn up .\nthe drethlords were a bit troubling , dracen exasperating , and the growing camp was a headache .\neven so , none of it was a real problem , if he was with her .\n`` cade ? ''\nshe whispered , just to hear his voice .\n`` yes ? ''\nhe straightened at the door of the tent , the warmth of the summer morning sneaking past him .\n`` why are you awake ? ''\nshe murmured , burying her face in her pillow once more .\n`` it 's morning .\n.\n. ''\nhe pointed out , laughter in his voice .\nelaina peered over her pillow to examine the translucent canvas walls .\n`` no , too dark yet .\ntwo hours more . ''\nshe declared firmly , cuddling deeper into the linens .\n`` go back to bed . ''\n`` i 've already packed it for the day . ''\nnow there was a definite chuckle in his tone .\nher unwillingness to get up each morning was baffling to him , but hed let slip once how much he enjoyed watching her sleep .\nit had been a uncharacteristically sentimental , so she remembered .\nhe , of course , never lounged in bed once the sun hit the horizon .\nelaina groaned at the ever-disciplined war lord , but his stoic disregard for sleeping in gave her an idea .\n`` fine then , sleep here . ''\nshe suggested , rolling carefully over to one side of the cot .\nelaina put her head down at once , unwilling to wake up any farther and lose precious minutes .\nbesides , nonchalance was crucial for her little plan .\neither he would leave and she could sleep in peace , or perhaps he would actually come over .\nas the silence lengthened , elaina forgot she was expecting a response and drifted back towards sleep .\n`` you 're irresistible when you 're all messed up and sleepy , did you know ? ''\nhe said softly .\nelaina rolled over with a smile and lazy stretch that was supposed to be tempting .\nprobably just awkward .\nit was hard to move around without tipping her bed over or making it snap shut .\n`` so come to bed . ''\nshe offered again , realizing that the words could mean a lot more than she was offering .\neyes closed to feign disinterest , she listened for some reaction to her teasing .\nhe hesitated , then took three quick steps to sit on the side of the cot , balancing out her precarious bed .\nsuccess !\nbut she celebrated too soonhe did not lay down .\nimpatient , she peeked up at him .\noh my .\nhe stared at her so intently she forgot to be sleepy .\n`` i do n't think that 's a good idea . ''\ncade said .\nhe sounded strained , like a man trying to have a conversation while standing balanced on a taut rope .\n`` why not ? ''\nelaina murmured , confused and more than a little intrigued .\nher curiosity was waking her up , but it could be worth it .\nsometimes he said things at the oddest moments , things she would remember word for word for the rest of her life .\nif this was one of those moments she wanted to be awake .\nits something thats made him sound like this .\nso serious for so early in the day !\ncade inhaled deeply .\n`` you 're just .\n.\n.\nirresistible . ''\nhe said at last , as if it had been forced from him .\nelaina did n't laugh , though he was seldom so dramatic .\nwhat in arith is the matter with that ?\n`` irresistible .\nthats bad ? ''\nshe clarified , sitting upcarefully , as always .\na dark thought slipped through her mind : what if he 's finally realized that he could have any woman in the world , and all this is more trouble than im worth ?\ncade drew a deep shuddering breath .\nnot a man on a tightrope , a man on thin ice .\nher thoughts cast a pall on the bright morning .\nit felt like a fist had clenched in her stomach .\nwas he going to leave again , really leave ?\n`` it isnt bad , '' he assured her carefully , reading the look on her face .\ncade sighed , ran his hand through his dark hair in frustration , then finished quickly , `` i only worry i wont be able to resist the irresistible forever . ''\nelaina arched an eyebrow .\n`` then do n't , '' she suggested , leaning toward him .\nto her surprise , he jerked to his feet .\nhe even took a few steps back for good measure .\nthe cot wobbled dangerously , but she didnt notice , sinking back into the linens with a sudden chill .\n`` cade ? ''\nshe intended her tone to be playful and teasing , but the hurt had crept in somehow .\ntruth blast it !\nshe blushed .\nit seemed to affect him all the more .\npain twisted his features in a way elaina seldom saw .\nthen he came to sit next to her again , gingerly to keep the cot from tipping .\nher flash of anger at the blasted bed faded quickly as she waited for his answer .\n`` i cant risk you .\nim afraid ill hurt you . ''\nhe said at last .\n`` you ?\nher voice was thick with disbelief .\nyou would never hurt me . ''\nshe shook her head .\nnever .\n`` you dont understand .\nwhen i 'm close to you , i cant think at all .\ni cant think about miranyas warning .\ngiven half the chance id dismiss it . ''\nhe tried to explain .\ni would ignore it , explain it away .\nso i ca n't have that chance .\ni ca n't lose control that way , i might kill you .\ncade paused , lips set into a thin line .\ni would kill you . ''\nshame swam in his eyes , she gaped at him , mouth open .\nnot because he said he 'd kill herthat she did n't believe and never would .\nit was the whole premise that shocked her .\nhe thinks his self control is not strong enough ?\nhim .\nthe antralian battle lord , the ashendari .\nthe man with discipline to make steel look flimsy ?\ntruth , but he really does want me !\nelaina blushed and tried to wipe away the smile that tugged at her lips .\nit was all she could do not to giggle like a farm girl , but that would be insensitive with him looking so shamefaced .\nshe did n't suggest that she might have the self control he lacked .\nall he had to do was smile that slow , crooked smile and she was finished .\nthen she realized what risking her life meant : risking his too .\nfrustration bubbled up through her delight .\nshe 'd found the most perfect man in arith , and he even loved her back , but they still could n't be together , all because some jealous sorceress cursed warning !\ni almost wish miranya hadnt said anything .\nmight have been worth it to figure it out on our own .\n.\n.that sneaking witch , even after shes dead shes still interfering .\nthe foul , lying little `` what if miranya lied ? ''\nshe burst out .\ncade blinked at the force of her suggestion , and she used his hesitation to babble on before doubt could take root .\nshe had no reason to tell the truth , and she was hardly looking out for our best interests . ''\n`` you want to risk your life on that chance ? ''\n`` at least it 's a chance ! ''\nelaina shot back , annoyed by his lack of enthusiasm .\n`` i 'm not going to have a hand in your death , elaina . ''\ncade objected sternly .\nthat is the one thing you must never ask of me .\n`` and i 'm not going to have a hand in yours , either ! ''\nshe shot back , mind spinning for another way .\nif miranya was lying , we could be together !\nwe just need someone else who knows if she told us the truth .\n.\n.\nthats it !\n`` i 'll ask dracen .\nhe 'll know , one way or the other . ''\nelaina declared .\nit was perfect .\nthe brother would know , the whole system of watchers and wielders was imported from his homeland of asemal , after all .\nthats where miranya said shed learned about it .\nelaina let her smile grow .\nif dracen has the right answer !\n`` dracen !\nyou 're too shy . ''\ncade objected .\nshe set her jaw , and he must have recognized the mule-stubborn expression because his eyebrows rose .\nno doubt imagining me trying to utter such a question , or the look on dracen 's face if i did .\nelaina grimaced at the mental picture .\ncade saw her flinch and flashed a rueful grin .\nyoull never ask .\noh wont i ?\nelaina lifted her chin , jaw set .\nso he doesnt think i have the nerve for it , does he ?\nwell !\nwithout another word , she snatched her thin robe , shoved her arms through the sleeves , and marched out into the morning .\ncade stared after her .\nthere goes the woman who swims fully dressed , who refuses to get out of bed until i leave the tent , who would die of mortification if someone chanced to see her in her camisole .\nthat woman is going to march through the camp in her robe to ask dracen if !\nhe knew that the moment he made it a challenge she 'd try .\nhonestly , he had been counting on it .\nthe wielder was as shy as any northerner , certainly , but she was stubborn on an entirely different level .\nhalf thrilled , half terrified , he hurried to catch up before she barged into the brother 's tent .\nit was a crazy idea and an absolutely impossible question to ask with any sense of propriety , but cade was n't about to stop her .\nshe is the wielder after all , im just her watcher .\na small voice in the back of his head spelled out another highly convincing reason that had absolutely nothing with any of that , but cade ruthlessly shoved it down .\n`` you 're asking him now ? ''\nhe asked once he was close enough to be heard without shouting .\nno need to give these curious eyes anything more to consider .\neveryone we pass already looks stunned to see her awake and rushing the camp in a robe .\nhe hadnt been aware that she was capable of walking this quickly .\nher smooth reply answered both his question and his thoughts .\n`` no sense wasting time .\nthe sooner we know .\n.\n. ''\ncade felt his heart hammer in his chest and his breath catch .\n`` good grief , elaina ! ''\nhe growled , `` i thought northern women were shy ! ''\nher only response was a sly smile that sent his heart crashing against his ribcage again .\ntrue spirits !\nit did n't take very long to reach dracen 's tent .\ncade paused , but elaina called his name , waited two seconds , and went right in .\nhe darted after her , reaching for her sleeve an instant too late .\n`` elaina ! ''\nhe hissed .\nthe man might not even be dressed !\nwoman !\nher haste was gratifying , though .\ndracen , fully clothed , thank the neverblind , turned stiffly to face them .\none thin eyebrow arched at the two of them while he adjusted his grey cloak with the air of a cat twitching its tail at intruders .\nhis tent was perfectly barren of personal touches .\nbrother dracen is a serious man .\nthis ought to be good , cade mused .\n`` brother dracen , '' she began , `` good morning . ''\nthe brother nodded cautiously , eyes flicking over her shoulder to cade for a moment , then back .\nfor his part , cade kept his gaze fixed on the far wall of the tent .\nhe felt a little guilty for not helping her , but it was her idea .\nbesides , i dont want to push her .\nif i asked she might feel like she has to .\n.\n.\nfollow through , even if she changes her mind and doesnt want to .\nand i cant meet the brothers knowing eyes .\nhe could admit that to himself at least .\n`` you recall the incident with the poison , just before cade left ? ''\nelaina asked .\ncade bit his tongue to keep from interjecting .\nshe always called it the time 'when cade left ' while he referred to it as 'when elaina commanded me to leave . '\nit was something they tried not to discuss , since all of the discussions were arguments .\ndracen 's eyes lingered on cade a little longer this time , and he nodded a trifle slower .\nthey had n't told anyone precisely what had occurred that day , and as far as cade could tell , time had only made the whole lot of them more desperately curious .\nelaina went on , jerking him back the present .\nhe tried to keep his astonishment off his face .\nshe 's really going to ask !\n`` well , about that time a caster informed us that the linking makes it impossible for a watcher and his wielder to '' and here her courage ran out .\ncade was surprised she had made it as far as she did .\njust a few words short .\na few crucial and impossible words .\n`` that is , to erm .\n.\n. ''\nshe swallowed , waving one hand a little at her side .\ndracen 's silent , unblinking stare could not have helped her resolve .\ncade watched as her breath came faster and a blush stained her cheeks .\nhe did his best not to be too distracted by it .\nhis best didnt do very much .\nit never does , with her .\n`` well , she said it would be lethal , since the barriers dissolve .\n.\n.\nto .\n.\n.\nelaina stammered .\neyes like winter rainclouds narrowed in what might have been understanding and shifted to fix on cade .\nhe felt a chill down his spine , as he always did when the friendly brother reminded him too much of his hateful kin .\nafter a moment , though , he could see the beginnings of droll understanding in dracens eyes .\nhe knows .\nhe knows , he just wants to make one of us say it .\nif cade had been the sort of man to blush , hed have been as dark as elaina just then .\nthe flush of embarrassment had crept down her neck and now covered her chest as well .\nor all of it that can be seen .\ncade pulled his thoughts back from that delightful curiosity just as dracen prompted , `` to .\n.\n. ? ''\ncade shrugged one shoulder , but that was apparently expressive enough .\nthe brother shook his head and sighed with the air of a man weary with the predictability of young people .\nturning away from them to open the chest at the foot of the bed , he sifted through the contents and pulled out a cream-colored tile with a soft portrait of two people , a man and a woman .\nit looked out of place in the cheerless room .\n`` these are my parents . ''\nhe said handing it to a bewildered elaina .\ncade looked over her shoulder .\nit was clear that the two people were related to the brother , they had the same piercing eyes and sharp features that made their son such a formidable presence .\n`` that was made in asemal . ''\ndracen continued .\n`` before they left on a mission from which they never returnedoverzealous peasants . ''\nhe took it back from her and settled it carefully into the folded clothes beside a portrait a pretty young woman .\nwas he married , in asemal ?\nis there someone waiting for him to come home ?\nit was strange to think dracen had ever been in love .\nbut why else would he carry that picture ?\ncade eyed the man with startled curiosity .\nthe brother cut off his train of thought by shutting the trunk with a snap .\nthen he explained , `` it is a family tradition to serve the empress as casters . ''\ncade 's eyes jerked up sharply .\ndoes that mean ?\n`` my mother was very close to her , actually .\nthe empress valued her friendship and skill so highly , she assigned a watcher to her , unusual though that was for a mere caster . ''\nhe paused to look them both in the eye , `` that watcher was my father .\nit was not uncommon , with watchers and their counterparts relying on each other , protecting each otherthey very often married , in the end .\nit was generally encouraged .\nsomewhere in those grey eyes was the smallest flicker of warmth as delight lit elainas face .\nof course there is , even a glacier would be warmed by that expression on that girl .\ni wonder if he sees something of the girl in the picture , when he looks at elaina .\nor imagines the daughter the two of them might have had .\nthen elaina wheeled to face him , and cade forgot about dracen entirely .\nhe could n't help taking a sharp breath .\nsparks seemed to crackle between them , flashing against his fingertips when he reached out to take elaina 's elbow and steer her toward the door .\ndracen will understand if we dont thank him or say goodbye .", "Subject": "Andy", "label": "Gratitude & Joy", "source": "Bookcorpus_463.txt", "choices": ["Gratitude & Anger", "Embarrassment & Joy", "Sadness & Anger", "Gratitude & Joy", "Embarrassment & Sadness", "Embarrassment & Anger"], "length": 24583}
